How to structure an idea: What are the steps?
Ideas are a powerful tool that can help you get started on anything. They can be used to create new businesses, plan new trips, or even come up with new ways of looking at old problems. However, there are a few key rules you need to follow in order to create great ideas.
The first step is to have a strong idea of what you want your business or trip to do. Once you know what you want, it's important to figure out the steps needed to get there. This will help you build an outline for your business or trip that is specific and accurate.

Next, it's important to make sure your idea is interesting and innovative. If your idea isn't interesting or innovative, people may not be interested in starting your business or going on your trip.

Invention processes: What happens during the invention process?
Invention is the process that occurs during which a new idea or invention is created. This can be done through the creation of a new product, service, or idea. Inventions can also come about through the research and development of a new product. While both processes are essential to the success of an invention, they are also different. 
The invention process typically involves three steps: ideation, development, and commercialization. Ideation happens when an inventor has a great idea for a product or service and it doesn't yet have a name or prototype. Development happens when the inventor comes up with a working prototype of their product or service. Commercialization happens when someone decides to make their product or service available to the public. 

While all three steps are important, they each have their own importance.
