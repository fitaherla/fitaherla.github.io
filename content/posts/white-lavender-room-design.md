The role of big ideas in history
The role of big ideas in history is essential for understanding the past and shaping the future. Big ideas have the power to change the course of history, and they often do. From the American Revolution to the civil rights movement, big ideas have shaped our world.
Big ideas come in all shapes and sizes. Some are small and only affect a few people, while others are large and have a global impact. No matter their size, all big ideas have the potential to change the world.

History is full of examples of big ideas that have changed the course of events. The American Revolution was sparked by a few key individuals who had big ideas about freedom and democracy. These ideas spread like wildfire, eventually leading to independence from Britain.

The benefits of creative art: How does creativity benefit us?
Creativity has been shown to be beneficial in many ways, from helping people feel more creative and motivated, to improving our thinking and problem solving skills. However, there are also a number of other benefits that can come from creativity. Here are just a few: 
1. Increased understanding of complex topics. When people are able to understand complex concepts more clearly, they are better able to solve problems and make decisions. This is especially true when it comes to matters of the arts, as understanding how an image or painting is composed can lead to a deeper understanding of the subject matter at hand. 

2. Increased expression and communication. People who are more creative often have more natural communication abilities than those who aren’t. This is because creativity helps us express ourselves in a way that is both original and interesting.
