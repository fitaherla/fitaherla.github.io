What is the young adult book industry like today?
The young adult book industry is changing rapidly, and there are a number of different ways that it is doing so. One way that the industry is changing is in terms of how books are being published. 
Before, books were published as e-books and mailed to customers. This method allowed for less editing and revision, which made the books more straightforward to read. However, this type of publishing has been gradually replaced by the electronic book format. 

The electronic book format allows for a much wider range of content to be included in a book, making it more diverse and vibrant than ever before. Additionally, this format eliminates the need for physical copies of books, which makes them more cost-effective. 

As the industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see what new ways it comes up with to keep readers engaged and invested in its products.

brainstorming: What are some creative ways to come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are some basic types that you can use to come up with your own. Here are some creative ideas to get you started:
1. Brainstorm with others: Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to brainstorm with other people. This can help you get feedback on what might work and what might not, and it can also help you brainstorm ways to make your ideas even better.

2. Take a walk: One of the best ways to come up with new creative ideas is to take a walk around your neighborhood or town. This will give you a lot of different ideas for things to do and places to go, and it will also give you some good motivation for coming up with new concepts.
