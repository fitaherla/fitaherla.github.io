What challenges must be overcome in order to create successful inventions?
Inventions have the potential to change the way people live and work. But while they hold great potential, they also have a large challenge of overcoming many obstacles in order to be successful. One obstacle is the lack of understanding and knowledge about the inventor's process and how their invention can be used in the world. Another obstacle is the cost of patenting an invention. These costs can range from $1 million to $30 million, making them very prohibitive for many businesses. In order to overcome these challenges, businesses must develop a clear idea of what they are trying to achieve with their invention, as well as how it can be used in the world. This will help them come up with ideas that are both successful and affordable.
