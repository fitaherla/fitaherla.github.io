How do you get started with having ideas?
Ideas are a powerful tool that can help you get started on anything. Whether you have them all figured out or not, any ideas will help get your creative juices flowing. Here are some tips to get started: 
1. Find a place to sit and brainstorm: Whether it’s at home or in a meeting, sitting down and brainstorming ideas will help you come up with new plans and solutions. 
2. Take some time for yourself: Another way to start getting ideas is by taking some time for yourself. This can be done by reading, watching TV, or doing something that you love but which also allows you to think outside the box. 
3. Get organized: Once you have a few good ideas, it’s important to get them organized so that they can be used in future projects.

1. Idea Submission: How do you go about submitting an idea?
When you want to submit an idea to a news outlet, there are a few things you need to do in order to make sure your submission is accepted. 
You first need to create a proposal, which will include information about the idea and why it should be included in the outlet's story. You can also find resources online that can help you with this process, such as The White House's website or the National Broadcasting Corporation's website. 
Next, you need to go through an editing process and make sure your idea is ready for publication. This may involve some changes, but it is important that your submission meets all requirements before it is sent for review. 
Once your idea has been edited and approved by staff at the outlet, you will then need to promote and sell your submission to potential customers.

The Challenge of Innovation: How do we stay ahead of the curve?
Innovation is a challenge for any organization, but it's especially hard to keep up with the curve when it comes to technology. Many times, innovation can come from scratch or from taking an existing product and changing its features or design. But whether it's something as simple as a new way of packaging food or a transformed business model, staying ahead of the curve can be tricky.
One way to overcome this challenge is to build on what others have done before. This can be done through collaboration and learning from others, as well as by listening carefully to what customers want and need. It's also important to focus on what customers want most, rather than just trying to please everyone.

There are several ways that an organization can stay ahead of the curve when it comes to innovation.
