brainstorming: What are some creative ways to come up with ideas?
Creative ideas are the lifeblood of any business. Whether it's coming up with new ways to market your company or coming up with new products or services, creativity is key. Here are a few creative ideas to get you started: 
1. unconscious brainstorming - This technique is when you come up with ideas without knowing why or how they'll help your business. Just think about what could work and then start thinking about ways to make it a reality. This can be fun because it can result in something that you never thought possible. 
2. using prototypes - A prototype is a version of an idea that's been created specifically for testing and feedback purposes. It can help you explore different aspects of your product before finally committed to making it a reality.

The brainstroming phenomenon is when people's thoughts track the same topic for a sustained period of time. In some cases, this can be an extended period of time - for example, if someone has been thinking about the same subject constantly for a few days or weeks. In other cases, it may be more sporadic - for example, if someone thinks about the same topic once and then doesn't think about it for a week or two.

The Creative Process: How do you come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come to us in all shapes and sizes. Sometimes they are easy to come by, and other times they require a bit of effort but can be really rewarding. Here are some tips on how to come up with creative ideas:
1. Brainstorm with others: When brainstorming, always consider what others might have in mind. Talk to your friends, family, co-workers, or even strangers about the idea you’re thinking of and see if anyone has any ideas that might work better.

2. Take a step back: Once you’ve come up with an idea, it can be helpful to take a step back and look at it from a different perspective. This will help you think about ways to make it more effective or unique.

Invention inspired by nature: Why did people come up with new inventions based on nature?
Nature has always been a source of inspiration for new inventions. People have come up with new ways to do things based on natural phenomena for centuries. Some of the most famous examples include the wheel, the pyramids, and the light bulb. Today, we continue to see people come up with new ideas based on nature because technology has advanced so much since then. There are countless ways that technology can be used to improve our lives, and one of the most common ways it is used is through invention. Invention ideas are often based on something that already exists in nature and can be used in a more efficient way or with less effort than what people have currently thought of.
