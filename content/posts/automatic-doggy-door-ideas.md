The Industrial Revolution and Inventions
The Industrial Revolution and Inventions
Invention is often thought of as a lightbulb moment, or a eureka! experience. But invention is also the result of years of incremental improvements by many people. This was certainly the case during the Industrial Revolution, when a number of different inventions led to unprecedented economic growth.

One of the most important inventions of the Industrial Revolution was the steam engine. The steam engine allowed for factories to be built away from water sources, and it also made it possible to power trains and ships. Another key invention was the spinning jenny, which increased the efficiency of textile production.

Other notable inventions from this period include the telegraph, which revolutionized communication; photography, which changed the way we view the world; and the gasoline-powered internal combustion engine, which would eventually lead to the automobile.

Change 2: How to improve the efficiency of your kitchen
If you're like most people, you probably spend a lot of time in your kitchen - whether cooking or cleaning. But it's not just the act of cooking that can be improved by creating a more efficient system; cleaning and organization can also be improved. Here are some tips to help you become more efficient in your kitchen:
1. Create clear dividers between the cooking and cleaning areas. This will help create space for you to move around and do other tasks in an organized manner.

2. Use positive reinforcement when you see results from your cleanliness efforts. For example, if you see that your kitchen is dirty but you're still making progress, give yourself a pat on the back! This will keep your motivation high and make sure that you continue to make good progress.

3. Use organizers to help with storage and organization.

What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but it's not just about ideas. It's about how you develop and pursue them that makes them truly good. Here are three tips to help you make great big ideas:
1. Do your research 
Before any big idea has a chance to grow, it's important to do your research. By understanding the industry, the competition, and what people are using or thinking of, you can create a better idea that is Tacoma-specific and relevant to your area. 
2. Be persistent 
With a good idea in mind, don't be discouraged if it doesn't quite hit home at first. Keep pushing yourself and see where things take you. Once you have a solid concept and market segmentation, you can start working on developing those details (marketing strategy, product design, etc).
