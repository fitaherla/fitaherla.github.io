The Importance of having Good Ideas
Good ideas are important for any business. They can help make a product or service more successful, and help to cut costs. But without good ideas, there would be little chance of making a profit. So how do you find and develop good ones? Here are four tips:
1. criteria your idea must meet: your target market, what they need, how you can improve on what they have already done
2. come up with a detailed plan: make sure your idea is unique and solves a problem that the target market knows exists
3. test it: do people actually use what youâ€™ve come up with? If not, refining it will cost time and money
