The power of suggestion
Creative ideas are the key to any business or project. When you have a good idea, it's easy to set out to find someone who can help turn that into a reality. Whether you're looking for help with your creative vision or just some recommendations for new companies or products, giving people the opportunity to suggest ideas is one of the most important tools you have in your toolbox.

Second, it needs to be something that they think could benefit others. And finally, it needs to be something that they think would be interesting and potentially useful for your project or business.
