Invention inspired by nature: Why did people come up with new inventions based on nature?
Nature has always been a source of inspiration for new inventions. People have come up with new ways to do things based on natural phenomena for centuries. Some of the most famous examples include the wheel, the pyramids, and the light bulb. Today, we continue to see people come up with new ideas based on nature because technology has advanced so much since then. There are countless ways that technology can be used to improve our lives, and one of the most common ways it is used is through invention. Invention ideas are often based on something that already exists in nature and can be used in a more efficient way or with less effort than what people have currently thought of.

What are the different types of art you can create? What is the difference between creative and non-creative art? Why is creativity important?
Creative art is often characterized by its unique and expressive elements. It can be considered to be an individual form of expression, or a way to express oneself. Non-creative art, on the other hand, is often based on the same parameters as creative art but does not typically have as much expressive power. It can be considered more bland or conventional.
