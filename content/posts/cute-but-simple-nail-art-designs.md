Invention ideas: How to come up with new ideas?
There are countless ways to come up with new ideas, but one of the most effective methods is to brainstorm. By Brainstorming, you can come up with a number of different ideas that could potentially be turned into a successful product or business idea. Here are a few tips on how to brainstorm:
1. Start by thinking about what you know and what others have done. This will help you come up with ideas that are based on your experience and knowledge rather than on something that you think might be impossible.

2. Be open to new ideas and don’t be afraid to challenge yourself. If an idea sounds interesting, go ahead and pitch it to someone who might be willing to invest in it.

3. Be patient and don’t hurry things.

What are some common problems that come with big ideas?
There are a number of common problems that come with big ideas, including: 1) not knowing how to conceptualize and execute them; 2) not knowing what to do with positive feedback when it's available; and 3) not being able to focus on the bigger picture. If you're struggling with any of these issues, here are some tips to help you overcome them: 
1) Draw on your own personal experience or experiences from others in order to understand what works for them. This will help you gain a better understanding of how your idea can be executed. 
2) Take a step back and analyze your idea in terms of its overall goal rather than just individual goals. This will help you figure out whether or not it's worth pursuing. 
3) Don't be afraid to ask for help when it comes time to execute your idea.

Types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, and gestural.
Creativity is a two-fold process. There are creative visual and auditory experiences, as well as creative gestural experiences. Gestural creativity refers to the ability to create unique or innovative designs through the use of gestures. Gestural creativity can be seen in artists such as Michelangelo and Vincent van Gogh, who were known for their innovation in artistry. Visual creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using their eyesight and vision. This can be seen in paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, Caravaggio’s The Nude Descending from the Cross, and Picasso’s Guernica. Artists use their eyesight to see what they want to create, and then use their imagination to make it real. Audiogenic creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using sound instead of sight.
