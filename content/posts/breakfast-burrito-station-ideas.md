The rules of brainstorming.
1. Brainstorming is a process that can be used to generate ideas and solve problems.
2. There are some rules that should be followed when brainstorming, in order to make it more effective.

3. The first rule is to suspend judgment while ideas are being generated. This means that no idea should be immediately rejected, no matter how crazy it may seem at first.

4. The second rule is to allow for freewheeling association. This means that ideas should be generated without any restrictions, and any connections between ideas should be explored.

5. The third rule is to build on the ideas of others. This means that once an idea has been suggested, others should try to build on it and expand upon it.

6. The fourth rule is to record all of the ideas that are generated during the brainstorming session.

The role of innovation in business: How important is innovation in business?
Innovation is key to any business. Without innovation, businesses would not be able to compete in the marketplace. Innovation also helps businesses succeed in the long run by creating new ideas and concepts that can be turned into successful products or services. There are a number of different ways innovation can help businesses succeed, but one of the most important methods is through creativity. By coming up with new ideas that are not commonly thought of and working on them until they become a reality, businesses are more likely to succeed than if they just stick to what is common wisdom.
