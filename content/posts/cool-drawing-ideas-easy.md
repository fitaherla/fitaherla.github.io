Innovation is the process of coming up with new or innovative ways to do something. Sometimes, innovation is something that is seen as a backward step, but in reality it can be the key to a companyâ€™s success. Innovation can come from looking at things from a different perspective, or from finding new ways to do something. It can also come from taking risks and trying something new that might not be popular or successful before.
