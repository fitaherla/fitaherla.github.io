Invention: The history of invention
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, whether it is a new product, service or technology. It has been around for centuries and has had a wide variety of outcomes. 
One of the earliest examples of invention was in 100 BC when two brothers, Eudoxus and Philoctetes, came up with the idea of writing. They were the first to patent their invention and it soon became a household word. 

Inventions have also been used for military purposes. The world’s first anti-tank grenade was created by Raphael Salomon in 1795 and it was used in World War 1 to help destroy German tanks. 

Today, innovation continues to play an important role in our lives. There are many different ways that innovation can be used to create new products, services and technologies.

Where to find them: Look around you
Invention ideas are everywhere. Look around your home, office, or neighborhood and you’ll find countless potential inventions just waiting to be created. Here are a few tips on where to find invention ideas:
Start by looking at everyday items and thinking about how they could be improved. For example, does your favorite coffee mug have a design flaw that makes it difficult to hold? Could your toothbrush be more ergonomic?

Pay attention to problems you encounter in your daily life. Is there an annoying task that you wish there was a machine to do for you? Is there a product that you can’t find that would make your life easier?

Keep a notebook with you and jot down any ideas that come to mind, no matter how small or silly they may seem. You never know when inspiration will strike!
