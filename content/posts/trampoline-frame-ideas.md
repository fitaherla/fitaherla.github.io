What are some ideas?
When it comes to ideas, no one is an expert. Everyone has different ideas and opinions on what should be done, which is why it's important to have a general idea of what you're looking for when coming up with ideas. Here are some key tips to help you get started:
1. Consider the audience: What will the idea be effective for? Is it for a small group of people, or a large one? What are their needs and wants?

2. Think about potential solutions: Once you've determined who or what your target audience is, consider what problems could be solved by using the given idea. Are there any potential drawbacks or challenges associated with this solution that you didn't account for? If so, these should be considered indepth before finally coming up with a plan.
