The 4 types of ideas: creative, critical, problem-solving, and emotional
Creative ideas are always intoxicating, and can be a great way to get your creative juices flowing. However, it's important to be careful with what you create – too much creativity can lead to problems. Here are four types of ideas that can help you get your creative juices flowing: problem-solving ideas, emotional ideas, and critical ideas.
Problem-solving Ideas: 
1) Come up with ways to make the existing structure of your business more efficient or effective. This could mean finding ways to cut costs or improve efficiency, or coming up with new ways to appeal to customers. 
2) Use your creativity in order to come up with solutions to problems that have been bothering your customers for years. For example, if you're a restaurant, come up with new menu items that appeal specifically to people who are struggling financially.

Invention definition: A creative act or process of coming up with a new idea or product.
Inventions are the backbone of business. They allow companies to make new products and services, without having to go through the trouble of developing them from scratch. And they do this by simply coming up with a new idea, or creating a better design than what was previously available.
However, there are different types of inventions. Some are more creative than others. Here, we will take a look at five different types of inventions:

1) Science fiction: Science fiction is a genre of speculative fiction that deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology, space exploration, time travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. It has been called the "literature of ideas", and often explores the potential consequences of scientific, social, and technological innovations.

2) Pharmaceuticals: Pharmaceuticals are products used to treat diseases or improve their symptoms.

What are some good ways to come up with ideas?
Ideas are one of the most important things a person can have. They can help you come up with new ideas for products, services, or anything else you might need to do. Here are some tips on how to come up with ideas: 
1. Take a look at what people have been working on and see what works well for them. Sometimes the best way to figure out what someone is working on is to watch them work so you can copy their methods and approach. 
2. Look at other people’s work and see how they have approached problem solving. This will give you a good idea of what works well for others and you can adapt it for your own business. 
3. Talk to other businesses and see how they approach coming up with ideas.
