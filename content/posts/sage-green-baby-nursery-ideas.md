What is brainstroming?
The term "brainstroming" has been used to describe a sudden, overwhelming feeling or experience that one has when thinking or focusing on a particular topic. This can be an especially strong experience when the focus is on a new or stimulus-rich environment. Brainstroming can be a warning sign that something important is looming, and it can be difficult to shake the attention span once it's achieved.
