How do we create innovation?
Innovation is a process of thought, creativity and change that occurs in any company. It can be found in everything from the smallest idea to the biggest product. To create innovation, itâ€™s important to have a clear definition of what you want your product or service to achieve, as well as how you plan on achieving it. Additionally, itâ€™s essential to have a clear vision for the future and how your product or service will help make that vision a reality. Lastly, itâ€™s essential to keep all of these things in mind when developing your product or service â€“ otherwise you may find yourself at risk of becoming stagnant in your industry or at risk of becoming irrelevant.
