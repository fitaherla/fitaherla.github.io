The risks and benefits of implementing big ideas.
Big ideas are important for businesses and individuals because they can help make large changes in how we live, work, and spend our time. However, implementation of big ideas can be risky and difficult. Here are four key dangers to avoid:
1. Losing sight of the goal: When a business or individual begins to focus on implementing a big idea, they may forget the main reason they created the idea in the first place- to make a difference in people’s lives.

Definition of creativity: How does creativity differ from other forms of thought?
Creativity is often thought of as a type of thinking. However, creativity is not just a mental process. It can also bedefined as the ability to come up with new ideas and concepts that are different from those that have been done before.
