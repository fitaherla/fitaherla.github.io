Different Types of Creativity: Why does one type work better than another?
Creativity is a complex and subjective thing. There are many factors that influence it. One of the most important ones is creativity's ability to imagine new things. One type of creativity, called brainstorming, is often used in creative workflows. It allows people to generate new ideas and concepts rapidly. But there are other types of creativity as well, so why does one work better than another?
Some research has shown that creativity is linked with problem solving. When people come up with ideas for products or services, they tend to be innovative and solve problems quickly. This type of creativity is often effective when it comes to creating new products or services. However, another study found that brainstorming was not as effective as problem solving when it came to creating new solutions for common problems.
