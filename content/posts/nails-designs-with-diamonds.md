The process of inventing: Describe the process of inventing, from idea to execution.
Invention is the process of bringing an idea or concept into reality. Inventors typically start with an idea, which they then refine and develop through research and experimentation. Once they have a prototype or working model of their invention, they may test it to see how well it works. If it is successful, they may then apply for a patent to protect their invention from being copied or used without permission. Invention is a creative process, and like any creative endeavor, it requires passion, dedication, and hard work.
