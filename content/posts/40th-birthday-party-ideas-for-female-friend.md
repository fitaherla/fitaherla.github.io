conclusion
Writing can be a difficult and daunting task, especially when it comes to coming up with creative ideas. However, there are some ways to make the process easier and more fun. Here are three tips to help you get those creative juices flowing:
1. Get organized: This may seem like a no-brainer, but getting your ideas down in a organized fashion will help you immensely when it comes time to start writing. Having everything sorted out ahead of time will allow you to focus on the actual writing, rather than trying to come up with what comes next.

2. Take breaks: Sometimes the best way to come up with fresh ideas is to take a break from writing altogether. Go for a walk, listen to music, or just step away from your work for a few minutes.

What is the difference between big ideas and small ideas?
Small ideas are the bread and butter of creativity. They are easy to come up with, and can be turned into something big if you're willing to put in the WORK. Big ideas are the stuff that can take your work to a whole new level. They're the ones that will challenge you and make you rethink everything you know.
