Discussion: How can we find and use the best ideas for our goals?
If you're like most people, you have some goals that you want to achieve. However, what do you do with the ideas for achieving those goals? 
There are a lot of ways to find and use the best ideas for your goals, but here are four that may be particularly helpful: 

1) Look at what others have accomplished - This is probably the simplest way to find good ideas, as it's all around us. When looking at what others have done, ask yourself how could you perform better or accomplish more of the same? What was their goal? What did they do to achieve it? You'll likely find a lot of great ideas in this category. 
2) Brainstorm - Brainstorming is another great way to come up with new ideas. Again, ask yourself why something might be an effective approach or solution.

The history of innovation
Innovation has been a key driver of human progress for centuries. Some of the most important innovations in history include the development of agriculture, the industrial revolution and the creation of the internet.
Today, innovation is more important than ever. We live in a world where new technologies are constantly being developed and where businesses need to be constantly innovating to stay ahead of the competition.

Innovation is not just about developing new products or services, it’s also about improving existing ones. It’s about finding new ways to do things that are faster, easier or more efficient.

So what does the future hold for innovation? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure – it will continue to be a driving force behind human progress.
