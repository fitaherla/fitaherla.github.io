Invention ideas are the lifeblood of business innovation. By understanding the basics of how these ideas work, businesses can come up with clever new ways to get things done. Here are a few examples: 
1. fintech: At first glance, this term may not seem like an invention idea, but it is in fact a company that revolutionized the way credit cards work by developing a technology that connects buyers and sellers on a global scale.
2. big data: This term is often used to describe data that is too large and complex to be manageable by traditional methods such as analysis or prediction. For example, big data may be used to identify trends in customer behavior so businesses can better target their marketing efforts. 
3. drones: Drones have quickly become one of the most popular invention ideas on the internet, and there are several reasons for this.

The future of transportation
The future of transportation is packed with potential. Some of the ideas being floated include: driverless cars, totally autonomous transportation, and even flying cars. All of these projects have a lot of potential to improve our quality of life and save us money in the long run. But how do you go about making these ideas a reality? And what are some early steps that could help make them a reality? Here are four tips: 
1. Start with small steps 
If you want to see large-scale transportation projects take off, it’s important to start with small steps. This means taking things like creating bike lanes or getting single-occupancy vehicles registered on the road. It also means looking at ways to reduce congestion and improve safety. 
2. Get involved in community deliberations 
Community deliberations are key in helping to create successful transportation projects.

Creative expression: The creative act and the creative media
Creative expression is the process of coming up with new ideas, expressing them through creative means and then sharing these ideas with others. The creative act involves the individual’s thoughts, feelings and creativity as well as the medium through which they are expressed. The creative media includes both tangible and intangible forms, such as art, music, motion pictures and television. As we learn to express ourselves more creatively, we also learn to create more effectively in order to improve our businesses, relationships and lives.
