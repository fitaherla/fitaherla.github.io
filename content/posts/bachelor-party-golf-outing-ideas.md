What To Do When You Have an Idea: What to do with it?
There are a few things you can do when you have an idea for something to do. The first is to make sure that it's something that you're interested in, and second is to see if there's anyone who can help you with it. If you don't have any help from others, or if someone you know is already working on something similar, the third step is to come up with a plan of how you'll go about doing it. The fourth step is to make sure that your idea is something that people will want to do. If your idea isn't something people are excited about, they might not be willing to invest time and energy into it. The fifth step is to find someone who can helpyou execute your idea. This could be someone who has experience in the field, or someone who can helpyou come up with more specific ideas.
