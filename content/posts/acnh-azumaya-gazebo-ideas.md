The future of business depends on how social media affects the way businesses operate. This is evident in the way that online communities, such as Facebook and Twitter, have created an individualized society where people are more interconnected than ever before.

Research: How can you test your hypothesis?
In the 1970s, scientists were using what is now known as “the scientific method.” This method involved testing a hypothesis with experiments. Today, scientists use a variety of methods to test their hypotheses, including “gambling on the theory.” In this technique, people bet money on whether or not a particular theory will be proven true. If the bet is successful, then the theory is considered true; if not, then the theory is considered false. gambling on theories can help scientists learn more about their research subjects and make better decisions about what to study.
