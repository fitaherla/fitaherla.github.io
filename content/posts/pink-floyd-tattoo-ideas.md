Prototype creation
Inventors often have a great idea for a product or invention, but don't know how to create a prototype. There are many ways to create prototypes, and the best method depends on the type of product or invention. Here are some tips for creating prototypes:
If you have an idea for a physical product, the best way to create a prototype is to find someone who can help you build it. This could be a friend or family member who is good with tools, or you could hire a professional. Once you have your prototype, you can show it to potential investors or manufacturers to get feedback and interest in your product.

If your invention is more of an intangible concept, such as a new app or software program, you can create a prototype yourself using basic coding language. This will give you a chance to test out your idea and see if it's feasible.

Creative Solution: How do I come up with creative ideas?
Creative solutions come in all shapes and sizes, but the key is to find the right one for your needs. Here are a few tips for coming up with creative ideas:
1. Get inspired by other projects you’ve worked on. When you see creative solutions that are similar to yours, it can be easy to come up with ideas. This way, you won’t have to spend hours brainstorming until you find the right solution.

2. Be open to new ideas. It can be hard to be creative when everything else around you is familiar and cookie-cutter. But don’t be afraid to submit new ideas if they seem interesting or if someone else has already created a similar solution.

3. Take your time. Don’t get wrapped up in too much hurry when it comes to coming up with creative solutions.
