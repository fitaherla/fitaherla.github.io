How can we turn big ideas into real projects?
How can we turn big ideas into real projects? There are a few key strategies that can help. First, we need to identify the big idea. Once we know what it is, our next step is to develop a plan for how to make it a reality. Once we have a plan, it’s time to gather the resources necessary to make it happen. This might include money, manpower, or other resources that we can borrow from others or give away. If all of these resources are available, the next step is to put together a team of advisors who can help us achieve our goals. Finally, once we have achieved our goals and made progress towards our target date, it’s important to celebrating and measuring the success of our project in order to maintain motivation and accountability.

Introduce the topic of invention ideas
Most people never think about invention ideas until they see a commercial for a new product on television. Even then, the average person rarely stops to think about how that product was created or what it took to bring it to market. The process of invention is one that takes a lot of time, energy and dedication. Inventors are some of the most creative people in the world. They look at the world around them and see problems that need to be solved.
Invention ideas can come from anywhere. Sometimes inventors are inspired by nature, other times they see a problem and work to find a solution. There are also times when an inventor comes up with an idea for a product that is completely new and unique. No matter where the idea comes from, all inventions start with an idea.

The first step in turning an idea into an invention is doing some research.

The Process of Being Creative
When it comes to creative ideas, the process can be a bit mysterious. Where do they come from? How can you get more of them? While there's no one answer to these questions, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of having a great idea.
First, make sure you're exposing yourself to new things. Ideas often come from seeing something in a new way or combining two disparate things. If you're stuck in the same old routine, it'll be harder to have those "a-ha!" moments.

 Second, give yourself time and space to daydream. Once you have an idea, it's important to let it percolate for a while before taking action on it. Often, the best ideas come when you're not actively trying to think of one.

Finally, don't be afraid to experiment and take risks.
