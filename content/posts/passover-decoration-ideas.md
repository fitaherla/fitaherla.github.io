The power of brainstorming: What are some good tips for brainstorming?
brainstorming is a great way to come up with new ideas. It can be used for anything from developing new products to finding a new business idea. Here are five tips for brainstorming: 1) Be specific about what you want to come up with. This will help you focus on the best ideas and avoid getting stuck in your routine. 2) Make sure you have a clear goal or target audience in mind before starting. This will help you find potential solutions that are relevant to your target market. 3) Work together with other people.
