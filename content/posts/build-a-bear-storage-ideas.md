Idea 3: A new way to communicate information
An invention that could be used to communicate information more effectively than ever before is a technology called "messageUltra." This new communication system would use sound waves instead of text or images to convey information. The sound waves would be sent through the air and sent directly to the recipient's ears, allowing them to hear the message without having to read it. This could be an extremely helpful tool for schools, businesses, and other organizations who need to communicate with large groups of people more efficiently.

Sometimes these big ideas are developed by teams of people working together, and sometimes they are created by someone who is just thinking out loud. Regardless of who came up with the idea, it is important to diffuse it and see if anyone else can come up with a better option.
