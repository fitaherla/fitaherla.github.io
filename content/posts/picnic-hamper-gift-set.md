Definition: Creative art is any art that is not traditional or common.
Creative art is not usually associated with traditional or common art styles. Instead, creative artists often use their own unique styles that are not typically found in other genres of art. This can be seen in many different forms, such as moderniste, cubist, and post-impressionist painting.

Conclusion: What is creativity and what does it mean for us?
Creativity is a term that has been around for centuries and means different things to different people. In its broadest sense, creativity refers to the ability of people to come up with new ideas and concepts. It can also refer to the state of mind in which an individual is in when they are creative. The definition of creativity also varies from person to person, so it’s important to define what creativity actually means for us all. It could mean different things depending on our individual backgrounds, experiences, and goals. However, whatever the definition, creativity is something that we all need to focus on if we want to achieve our creative goals.
