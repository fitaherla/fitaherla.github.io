The Future of Housing: How will technology change housing and homelessness?
Technology is already changing many aspects of our everyday lives, from how we shop to how we cook. It could soon change the way we live and work too, with implications for housing and homelessness. This article will explore some of the possibilities. 
One idea is that technology could help to create more affordable housing by providing a more accurate representation of what people actually need and want in their homes. Another possibility is that it could help individuals or groups who are homeless or at risk of homelessness to find new homes, either through advertizing or directly working with landlords. 

All of these ideas are just starting to be considered, and there are still many questions remaining about how they will be implemented. However, if done correctly, these changes could have positive impacts on both individuals and groups who need housing but don't currently have it.

Other Ideas: How do you go about thinking of other creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to improve the process of thinking. Here are a few tips on how to consider other creative ideas:
1. Look at your current work and ask yourself what you can improve. What are the areas that need improvement? How can you make those improvements?
2. Brainstorm with a group of people. When you come up with new ideas, it can be helpful to have others involved. Why not group together and brainstorm some potential solutions to problems you're currently facing? This will help you to formulate new ideas more effectively.
3. Take a step back and think about your goals. Once you've identified some areas that need improvement, what do you want to achieve with your change? What kind of results do you envision for your new efforts?

Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of bringing new ideas or products to market using creative and efficient methods. Innovation can be found in any industry, but typically it refers to technology, business, and product innovation.
There are many ways to define innovation, but one way that has become increasingly important is the definition provided by Matt Ridley in his book "The Innovator's Dilemma." Ridley defines innovation as a state of mind: "Innovation always means change, not just alteration of what has been done before." He goes on to say that innovation should be based on the following four factors: creativity, efficiency, novelty, and sustainability.

Creativity is a necessary component of any innovation process; without it, ideas will likely not make it past the initial stages of development.
