How do you come up with new ideas?
As a creative thinker, you face many challenges when coming up with new ideas. One challenge is that it can be difficult to remember just what worked the last time you came up with an idea. Additionally, it can be difficult to come up with novel approaches to problem solving.  So how do you come up with new ideas? 
One approach is to brainstorm. By brainstorming, you can get rid of any old ideas and start from scratch. Additionally, by using headphones or other distractions, you can create an environment in which you are unable to think of any other ideas. Finally, if you have a specific idea in mind but are not sure how to bring it to life, then you can try outframing or milking an existing idea for new potential insights.

Commercializing an invention: What is the commercialization process?
Commercialization is the process of bringing an invention to market and making it available to the general public. There are a number of different commercialization processes that can be used to bring an invention to market. The most common process is license-back, in which the inventor and licensee agree on a royalty schedule and terms of use. License-back usually occurs when an invention is filed with the USPTO. License-backs are also common when a patent application is filed with the USPTO. Other commercialization processes include industriallicense, which involves selling rights to use an invention in a specific industry; technologylicense, which allows manufacturers or other businesses to use an invention in order to create products or services; and netpatent, which allows inventors to make money by selling patents they receive from others.

How will you make sure that your content is useful and engaging?
The content of an article should be useful, engaging and interesting to the reader. It should also be clear, concise and easy to read. Here are 8 tips for making sure that your content is useful, engaging and interesting:
1. Take into account the audience you are addressing. What are the interests of your audience? Are they business owners, consumers or both? When writing for a specific audience, make sure to consider what information will be most effective for them.

2. Use clear language and images to help explain your ideas. People understand words more when they can see them clearly. Try using images throughout your article so that readers can visualize the concepts being discussed.

3. Use originality and creativity when creating new ideas. Don’t plagiarize other people’s work – it won’t make your content any better or more engaging.
