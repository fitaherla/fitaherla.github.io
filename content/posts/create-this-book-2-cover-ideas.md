Innovation: What makes a good invention?
Invention ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but the key to a good one is creativity. With new technology constantly evolving, it can be hard to identify what makes an invention successful. But here are four tips for finding the right innovation:
1. Know your target market. It may seem like a daunting task, but understanding your target market before you start developing your invention will help you design a product that meets their needs.

2. Don’t be afraid to take risks. After all, if it’s risk-free, then who is going to pay for it? If you have a good idea and can get people to invest in it, go for it!
3. Be nimble and fast-paced.
