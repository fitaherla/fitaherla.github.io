The future of food: How will we consume food in the future?
The future of food is still in question, but some ideas that have been floated include: 1) meal delivery services such as Uber and Deliveroo; 2) eating out less often; and 3) growing more of our food in the home. 
While these are all plausible options, there is also the potential for even more niche or Sustainable eaters to emerge, who will only consume sustainable or earth-friendly products. So what does this mean for consumers? 

When it comes to food, it means looking out for not just sustainability but also flavor. If you want your food to taste good, it needs to be nutritious and fresh. Fresh produce tastes better and is more refreshing on the palate, so if you can find earth-friendly or sustainable options that do both, go for it!

There are many different types of creative art, but some of the most common are painting, sculpture, film, and music.
There are many different types of creative art, but some of the most common are painting, sculpture, film, and music. While there are many great artists out there who specialize in one type of creative art, it is important to have an understanding of what the different types of creativity can do for an artist. For example, if you’re a painter and you want to create pieces featuring color and light, then you might use sculpture as your medium. However, if you’re a sculptor and you want to create pieces that are dark and moody, then you might use painting as your medium. The point is that there is no one right way to do creative art - it all depends on the artist's preferences and what they're interested in doing.

Overcoming obstacles: Discuss the challenges that inventors face and how they overcome them.
Invention is the process of coming up with an idea and turning it into a reality. It is a process that takes time, effort, and determination. Inventors often face many obstacles along the way, but they overcome them by being persistent and finding creative solutions.
One of the biggest challenges that inventors face is funding. Turning an idea into a reality can be expensive, and many inventors don’t have the money to do it on their own. They may need to find investors or take out loans to finance their invention.

Another obstacle that inventors face is making sure their invention is unique. There are already so many products on the market, and it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd. Inventors need to do their research and make sure their product is filling a need that isn’t being met by existing products.
