What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of making something new and different, whether it be in the form of a product, service or technology. Innovation is essential to the growth and success of any company. By definition, innovation means "a sudden change in the way things are done." In other words, it's the ability to come up with new ideas that can improve a business' bottom line.
However, while innovation is important, it isn't everything a company needs to thrive. In fact, too much innovation can lead to paralysis by analysis, which can prevent a company from taking advantage of current opportunities or changing its strategy in response to new trends. To be successful in the world of business, it's important to focus on both innovation and execution – two separate but equally important aspects of being innovative.

Overcoming Obstacles to Innovation
Innovation is critical to the success of any business, yet it can be difficult to achieve. There are a number of obstacles that can stand in the way of innovation, including a lack of resources, a fear of change, and a lack of creativity. However, there are ways to overcome these obstacles and create an environment that is conducive to innovation.
By identifying the obstacles that are standing in the way of innovation, businesses can take steps to remove them. One of the most common obstacles is a lack of resources. This can be addressed by allocating more funding to research and development or by partnering with other companies that have the resources needed.

Another obstacle that can impede innovation is a fear of change. This may be due to a reluctance to embrace new technologies or a fear that change will lead to disruptions in the business.
