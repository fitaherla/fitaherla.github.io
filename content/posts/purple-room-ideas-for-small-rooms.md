What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, and they can help spur new thought and innovation. Here are some of the most common big ideas:
1. We can all be more creative. big ideas can come from anywhere, but creativity is often found in the imagination. The more we can tap into our creativity, the better we'll be able to think of new ways to improve things.

2. There's no one right way to do something. Just because something seems impossible or impossible-minded, that doesn't mean it isn't possible or reasonable to try out for a change. A big idea is just a suggestion - so try out different ideas until you find the one that works best for you and your situation.

3. Disruptive innovation is key to success in any industry.

The Benefits of a Blog
If you're looking for ways to improve your blog and make more money, then a blog is a great place to start. Not only can you share your thoughts and experiences with your audience, but you can also sell your content through advertising or affiliate programs. Here are some of the benefits of having a blog: 
1) You can build brand awareness: When people see your name and know who you are, they're more likely to visit your website or read your posts. This will help increase traffic and revenue, which will in turn help you pay bills, buy items online, or pay off debt. 
2) You can build relationships with readers: When you have an active blog community and engage with readers on a regular basis, you'll create a valuable connection that'll last longer.
