What are big ideas?
There are always big ideas out there, and it can be tough to come up with the perfect one. Here are four tips on how to come up with the best ideas: 
1. Brainstorm with others. Collaborating is key when coming up with big ideas. Talk to people who have experience in the area you want to explore and see what they think would make for an interesting solution. 
2. Avoid clichés. When coming up with big ideas, be mindful of clichés and other tired patterns that have been done before. Are there other ways to approach this problem that haven’t been considered? What new angles could you take into consideration? 
3. Be open to feedback. Don’t be afraid to ask your friends and family for their opinion on your ideas before you EVEN start thinking about putting them together!

What are some ideas?
When it comes to ideas, no one is an expert. Everyone has different ideas and opinions on what should be done, which is why it's important to have a general idea of what you're looking for when coming up with ideas. Here are some key tips to help you get started:
1. Consider the audience: What will the idea be effective for? Is it for a small group of people, or a large one? What are their needs and wants?

2. Think about potential solutions: Once you've determined who or what your target audience is, consider what problems could be solved by using the given idea. Are there any potential drawbacks or challenges associated with this solution that you didn't account for? If so, these should be considered indepth before finally coming up with a plan.
