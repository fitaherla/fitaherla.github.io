The Role of Invention in Economic Development
Invention has been a key part of economic development for centuries. Inventions have allowed for new products and services to be developed and brought to market, which has led to increased profits and economic growth. 
However, as innovation increasingly becomes more important in the modern economy, some researchers are questioning the role of invention in economic development. Some argue that invention is not an essential ingredient for any viable economic system, and that instead it can lead to overutilization and even bankruptcy. Others maintain that while there can be negative consequences to excessive reliance on invention, it is also important to consider the potential benefits of innovation when designing economic systems.
