Innovation in healthcare: What new technologies are coming soon?
The healthcare industry is constantly developing new technologies to improve the quality and efficiency of care. Some of these innovations are coming soon, while others may still take some time to develop. Here are two examples of the latter. 
One technology is called "smart technology." This refers to devices that are specifically designed to improve patient care, such as providing real-time alerts or tracking patient vital signs. This can reduce the amount of time patients spend on their chart, make it easier for nurses to find needed medical supplies and personnel, and ensure that patients receive the best possible care. 

The other innovation is called "telemedicine." This refers to delivery of medical care over the Internet or other digital platforms. telemedicine has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by cutting costs and increasing efficiency.

The role of creativity in work: How does creativity impact productivity?
Creativity is a key factor in work. By definition, creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas and innovations. This can be seen in everything from creative writing to product development. In today's economy, creativity is becoming more and more important as businesses strive to stay competitive.
One way that creativity can help businesses is by providingidâ†’products or services that are not possible with traditional methods. For example, an idea for a new product could come from a brainstorming session where everyone comes up with different concepts. Once the product is developed, it could be marketed using creative ideas like creating slogans or marketing videos that are unique and engaging.

Beyond just products and services, creativity also plays an important role in team productivity. When people have access to fresh and innovative ideas, they are able to come up with better solutions faster.

Although creativity is often thought of as a tool that can be used for good, it can also be used to create harmful or negative ideas. For example, someone who is creative may come up with a new way to cook an egg, but if this person then starts to eat eggs out of the frying pan every day, they may begin to develop an egg-eating disorder.
