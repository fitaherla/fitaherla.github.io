What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make something that you and others will enjoy. Whether it's a new idea for a product or service, or an innovative way of thinking about your work, creativity is essential to any business. Here are some creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Take a walk on the wild side: When it comes to creative ideas, there's nothing quite like spending time out on the open range. Find an abandoned quarry or animal pen for inspiration, and see what kind of new designs come into being as a result. 
2. Experiment with technology: Sometimes the most interesting things are the simplest things. Use technology to help you find new ways to express your ideas, and see what happens when you switch up your methods and channels.

Brainstorming techniques
If you're stuck on how to generate creative ideas, try some of these brainstorming techniques:
1. Freewriting: Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and write nonstop about your topic. Don't worry about grammar or whether what you're writing makes sense. The goal is to get as many ideas down on paper as possible.

2. Brainstorming with someone else: Collaborating with someone can help stimulate new ideas. Throw around some potential ideas with a colleague or friend and see what they come up with.

3. Taking a walk: Sometimes the best way to clear your head and get some fresh perspective is to take a break from work altogether. Go for a walk outside and let your mind wander. You may be surprised at the new ideas that come to you when you're not even trying to think of them!

In order to come up with new ideas, it is often helpful to brainstorm with others. Brainstorming is a technique that is used to generate new ideas by thinking creatively about a topic or problem. This can be done individually or in a group setting. When brainstorming, it is important to not judge or critique ideas, but simply to come up with as many ideas as possible. Once you have a list of ideas, you can then start to narrow down and choose the best ones.
