Pre-existing Conditions: What are some potential solutions to this problem?
In recent years, there has been a growing trend of people looking for ways to help those who have pre-existing conditions. A variety of solutions have been proposed, with the most popular being increasing access to health insurance and creating new government programs that would help those with pre-existing conditions. However, each solution has its own set of disadvantages and drawbacks. One potential solution to this problem is increasing access to health insurance. This could be done through expanding Medicaid or creating new companies that offer affordable health insurance across all states. Additionally, increasing access to health insurance could also be done by reforming the Affordable Care Act so that it does not discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. The Affordable Care Act is a government program that helps people with pre-existing conditions get affordable health care.

creativity: How do you improve your invention ideas?
Creativity is essential to any invention. Every step of the process from Ideation to Execution should be tailored to increase creativity and improve the chances of a successful product. Here are four tips for improving your invention ideas:
1. Be persistent
Inevitably, every invention will not be perfect. That’s okay! The important thing is that you keep trying and learning until you find something that works well and can be improved upon. Keep a notebook or digital sketchbook where you can jot down ideas as they come to you, so you have access to them when needed. This way, you won’t get lost in your work and can focus on what really matters- developing a great product.

2. Be open to feedback
Feedback is key in ANY creative process.
