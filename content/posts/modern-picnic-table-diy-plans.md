The challenges of big ideas: What can prevent them from becoming successful?
When it comes to big ideas, sometimes the obstacles are simply too great. When it comes to innovation, often times what's required is a willingness to take on new challenges and risk everything for the sake of something better. But in some cases, taking such risks can actually backfire, leading to less innovation and more stagnation. Here are six examples of how big ideas can fail:
1) Failing to appreciate the uniqueness of each idea

One of the biggest challenges faced by big ideas is that they often come from unique perspectives or points of view. This can be difficult to take on and even harder to understand, let alone replicate. In order for an idea to succeed, it needs to be seen as unique and valuable in its own right – not just by those who came up with it but also by those who will use it in the future.

What is an invention?
There is no one definitive definition of an invention, but most Americans would likely say that an invention is a new product, process, or service.  Inventors often work on their inventions for years before they finally create a product or service that people can use. 
There are many different types of inventions, but some common ones include technological advances like the Telephone, Telegraph and Radio Act of 1847 (TCR), which gave us the ability to talk to each other over the air; and health advances such as aspirin and insulin in the 1800s. 

Inventions can have a profound impact on society and the economy. For example, TCR allowed for easier travel and communication across country boundaries. This made it possible for people from all corners of the world to meet and share ideas. Similarly, insulin helped people with diabetes control their medications more effectively.
