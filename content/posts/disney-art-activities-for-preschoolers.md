The Invention of the Electric Shock guitar
Electric shock guitars were invented in the late 1800s by George Lukacs, a musician and inventor. Lukacs had been playing an electric guitar that used alternating current (A.C.) to create sound, and he realized that electric guitars could be used for amplification. In 1892, Lukacs developed his first model electric guitar, the Electric Guitar Company's "Lukacs Guitars." The guitar was designed to be affordable and easy to play, with a single-coil pickup and a simple design. In 1934, Lukacs died at the age of 83, but his electric guitar remains one of the most significant instruments in history.

10 New Storage Ideas to Help You Organize Your Home
New Storage Ideas to Help You Organize Your Home
There are a number of ways to organize your home, and one way is to add storage space. One idea is to add a few shelves to the wall behind your TV or in the corner of the room where you keep your books, movies, and music. Another idea is to use an old cabinet as a makeshift storage unit. You can hang clothes in it, put books on top of it, or put toys in it. A third idea is to create a small interior shrine to your favorite thing. This could be a pottery jar with one of your favorite pieces of art inside, a picture from your childhood that you miss dearly, or any other piece of memorabilia that makes you happy. If you have children, they can help you select items for the shrine. Another way to organize storage is by using bins.
