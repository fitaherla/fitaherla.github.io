What are some new ideas that you came up with?
In the world of technology, there are a number of new ideas that come up constantly. Some of these ideas may be more innovative than others, but all of them have the potential to make a big impact on the way we live our lives. Here are a few examples:
1. The use of Blockchain technology: This technology is very similar to Bitcoin, but instead of using cryptography to secure transactions, Blockchain uses code that is kept track of and can be verified by other computers. This allows for secure and transparent transactions, which is why it has become so popular in recent years.

2. The use of AI*: This technology is quickly becoming one of the most important aspects of modern life. AI has been used in a variety of ways over the years, but its potential as an employer or strategist has yet to be fully realized.
