Conclusion: What does all this mean for artists today?
In the past few decades, creativity has become an increasingly popular word in the art world. This is mainly due to the rise of digital technology and its ability to allow for more creative expression.Today, artists have more opportunities than ever to express themselves through their work. However, there are some potential consequences of this newfound freedom that need to be considered.
One potential consequence is that people may no longer view artists as important or valuable members of society. This could lead to a decrease in patronage and investment from businesses and organizations that rely on creativity in their products or services. Additionally, it could prevent young people from learning about and learning from art as a form ofexpression.

Even though these consequences may be minor in comparison to other matters, they should be taken into account when making decisions about how best to support creative art today.

Development and commercialization: How do you make money from your invention?
Invention ideas are all around us. Whether it's a new product or an idea for a new company, something can be invented and made into a business. There are many ways to monetize an invention, but there is one way that is always popular and payout: profit sharing. Profit sharing is when an inventor gets a percentage of the sales generated from their invention. It can be a great way to make some extra money while your invention remains in the public domain. There are different types of profit sharing, but one of the most common is share-the- wealth, which means that inventors receive a cut of any profits made by their invention. There are also royalty shares, which give inventors a share of the royalties received from selling their invention.
