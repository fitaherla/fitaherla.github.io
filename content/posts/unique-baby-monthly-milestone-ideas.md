The role of big ideas in history
The role of big ideas in history is essential for understanding the past and shaping the future. Big ideas have the power to change the course of history, and they often do. From the American Revolution to the civil rights movement, big ideas have shaped our world.
Big ideas come in all shapes and sizes. Some are small and only affect a few people, while others are large and have a global impact. No matter their size, all big ideas have the potential to change the world.

History is full of examples of big ideas that have changed the course of events. The American Revolution was sparked by a few key individuals who had big ideas about freedom and democracy. These ideas spread like wildfire, eventually leading to independence from Britain.

The civil rights movement was another example of a big idea changing history.

Trends in computing: What new ways will information and communication technologies change the way we use and understand our world?
Technology has always had a huge impact on our lives. The development of information and communication technologies has led to a whole new level of interactivity and understanding between people and the world around them. Some of the most significant changes that will occur in this area are as follows:
