Creative art in the contemporary world: What challenges does creativity face in the 21st century?
Creativity is facing new challenges in the 21st century. One of the most important aspects of creativity is the ability to process information. Many modern day technologies have made it easier for people to get information and create artistry without having to leave their homes. However, this has also created some challenges for creatives. For example, many people no longer need to go outside to experience nature. They can now access creative content online or on screens all around them. This has created a problem for creatives, as they are no longer able to experience the natural environment around them. The other challenge creatives face is that technology has not always been accurate when it comes to depicting real life events and scenes. For example, many people believe that Trump was elected president because he had an "impenetrable" wall with Mexico. However, this is not accurate at all.

What is brainstroming and why is it important?
Brainstroming is a term that refers to the phenomenon of increased focus and productivity during periods of intense thought or concentration. Brainstroming is often seen as a benefit to people who are able to keep their minds focused on one task for more than a short period of time. Some believe that brainstroming can be used to improve problem solving, creativity, and decision making. However, there are several caveats to note when it comes to brainstroming. First, brainstroming can be difficult to maintain for any length of time; second, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to achieving maximal effectiveness; and third, individuals respond differently to different types of brainstroming interventions.

creating: How do you create ideas?
Creative ideas are a key part of any successful business. By understanding how to create and use creative ideas, you can improve your chances of success. Here are some tips to help you get started:
1. Come up with a specific idea. One of the most important things to do when creating creative ideas is to come up with a specific goal that you want to achieve. This will help you focus on what needs to be done instead of thinking about every possible option.

2. Look for inspiration. When looking for inspiration, don’t just look at things that have already been done or that have been popular in the past. Check out those that have gone above and beyond in order to get an idea of what you could do yourself (and make sure you avoid copying anyone!).

3. Be flexible.
