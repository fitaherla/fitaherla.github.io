7 Tips for the Purpose of Creativity: What are some tips for using creativity effectively in your work?
1. Make a list of ideas. This can be done in any format, but a list of ideas will help you to get started.
2. Think about how you can use the ideas on your list. If you cannot come up with an idea on your own, think about what others have done and what they used to achieve their goals.
3. Draw inspiration from other people and things around you. Studies have shown that imitation is one of the best ways to learn something new. Look at things around you and see how they have helped someone else achieve their goals or reached their dreams.
4: Take action! No matter what creativity may seem like, taking action is always the best way to go towards achieving your goals! Start by thinking of ways that you can improve or take actions that will help your creativity become successful.

Types of innovation: How they work
Innovation is the process of creating new products or services that are different from those that have been previously created. Innovation can be found in all industries, but is most common in the technology industry. In order to create innovative products or services, companies must first come up with a new idea, and then develop and test it so that it works. There are a number of different types of innovation, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. 
Product innovation: This type of innovation usually occurs when a company comes up with a new product idea that they believe will be successful. They then work on developing the product until it is ready to sell. Product development can be time-consuming, but can also lead to high profits if the product is successful. 

Service innovation: This type of innovation often occurs when companies come up with new ways to provide their customers with service.
