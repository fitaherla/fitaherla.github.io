Define brainstorming.
Brainstorming is a process that allows you to generate ideas and solutions by working with a group. The goal of brainstorming is to come up with as many ideas as possible, without judging or evaluating them. This can be done by writing down all the ideas that come to mind, or by using a technique called "brainstorming." Brainstorming is a technique that is used to generate new ideas by thinking creatively about a problem or issue. The key to effective brainstorming is to suspend judgment and allow the free flow of ideas.

Innovation in the global economy:
The global economy is constantly improving, with new and innovative technologies regularly coming onto the market. This increase in innovation has helped to drive down costs and increase efficiency, making life easier for consumers and businesses alike. However, as the global economy continues to grow, some challenges remain. One such challenge is that innovation often doesn't always trickle down to lower levels of society - in some cases, it can eveneaturedin the top tiers of businesses. This problem is called "inefficiency": When innovation takes place at a high level and benefits only a few people rather than everyone around them, it's often difficult for others to access or use the same ideas. Inefficiency can also lead to problems for the global environment - when businesses don't take into account environmental impact when making decisions about products or services, they can contribute to climate change.
