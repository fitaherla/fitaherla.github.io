Creativity is an innate quality that many people take for granted. However, without effort, creativity can often be wasted. For example, if you're creative in your artwork but don't have any ideas for products, you may not be successful in business. To be successful, creativity must come from the inside out – with ideas and solutions rather than just pictures in your head.

Winter weather: Tips to keep your home warm
If you're like most people, you probably think of winter as the time when your house is cold and unused. But that's not always the case. In fact, there are a few things you can do to keep your home warm during the winter. Here are some tips:
1) Keep your windows open at all times. This will let in natural sunlight, which will help keep your home warm.
2) Use a fireplace or heat pad. Fires add warmth to any space, and they also emit noxious gases which can help block out wind noise and cold air from coming in.
3) Place an electric blanket over every piece of furniture in your room. This will place an electric field between yourself and the elements, which will help keep you warm (or cooler) during the winter months.
