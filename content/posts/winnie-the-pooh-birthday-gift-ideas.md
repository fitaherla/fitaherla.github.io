What makes big ideas smart?
When it comes to big ideas, a little bit of thinking and creativity goes a long way. That’s why smarter ideas tend to be ones that are well-executed and scalable. Here are five ways to make your big ideas smarter:
1. Cut out the guesswork: By thinking ahead, you can remove any potential ambiguity or uncertainty. This will help you create a more organized plan and ensure that your idea is well-oiled from the get-go.

2. Carve out a specific target market: You need to identify who your target audience is before you begin working on developing your concept or product. Doing so will help you focus on the right areas of market opportunity and minimize overlap.

Conclusion: the importance of invention
Invention is the key to progress. It is the engine of change. It drives economies and creates new industries.
Invention is important because it leads to progress. Progress is defined as a forward or onward movement toward a destination. It is the opposite of regression, or a return to a previous state. In order for there to be progress, there must be invention. Invention leads to progress by creating new products, processes, or services that are more efficient than the existing ones. This increased efficiency can lead to improved quality of life for individuals and societies as a whole.

Invention is also important because it drives economies. Economies are systems of production and exchange that provide people with the means to support themselves and their families. They are powered by human labor, which in turn is driven by motivation and ideas. Ideas come from invention.
