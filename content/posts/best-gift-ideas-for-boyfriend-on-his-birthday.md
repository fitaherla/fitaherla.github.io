Other inventions: cars, trains, planes, etc.
If you're feeling uninspired by your current mode of transportation, never fear! There are plenty of other invention ideas out there waiting to be discovered. From cars to trains to planes, there's no shortage of ways to get around.
Take cars, for example. While the standard sedan is still a popular choice for many, there are now a variety of other options to choose from.
