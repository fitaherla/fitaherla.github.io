I’ve been fascinated by the brain for as long as I could remember. I love learning about it and its workings, and have spent countless hours reading and watching brain science documentaries. Now that I’m a doctor, I understand just how important brainstroming is to the health of patients and their families.

The difference between left brain and right brain thinking:
Most people use both sides of their brain for thinking, but some people tend to use one side more than the other. Left-brain thinkers are usually more logical and analytical, while right-brain thinkers are usually more creative.
Left-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like math and science, because they can break things down into smaller pieces and see the logic behind them. Right-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like art and music, because they can see the big picture and come up with creative ideas.

Both types of thinking are important, and most people use both sides of their brain for different tasks. But if you want to be good at something that requires creativity, then you’ll need to learn how to use your right brain more.

How can you improve your brainstroming skills?
If you're looking to boost your brainstroming skills, here are a few tips to get you started. First, keep track of how well you're doing on tasks that require thinking straight – such as solving problems or completing complex algebra problems. Additionally, practice focusing on one task at a time and try to force yourself to stay focused even when faced with difficult challenges. Finally, make sure that you have plenty of practice working with different types of materials (e.g., electronic computers, textiles, images), so that you can develop the critical thinking and problem-solving skills you need for any field.
