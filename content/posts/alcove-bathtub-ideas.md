What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything – a new way of looking at something, coming up with new ways to do something, or coming up with a new idea for a product. There are so many creative ideas out there that it can be hard to know what to choose from. Here are five tips to help you get started: 
1) Get inspired by your surroundings. When you're looking for creative ideas, take in the environment around you and try to come up with some ideas for products that would reflect the atmosphere. 
2) Be open to change. If you're not sure what you want your product to look like, don't be afraid to experiment and see what different styles work well for you. 
3) Take time for yourself. It's important to spend time relaxing and focusing on your creativity instead of working on things that are taking up your time.

Invention as an act or process: What are some examples?
There are many examples of Invention as an act or process. Sometimes people invent things just because they think they can and sometimes people invent things to help others. Inventors often have a vision for what they want their invention to be, and they work towards making that vision a reality. Some examples of Invention include: 
1) Wiring diagrams: Many inventions are born of need, like the Telephone. Mechanical engineers had been working on creating electrical wiring diagrams for centuries before Alexander Graham Bell came up with the idea for theTelephone.
2) The computer: Inventions like the transistor and laser were all born from necessity - computers did not exist until after WWII because scientists could not build them on a large scale.
3) The airplane: Wright brothers flew airplanes in 1903 without any assistance from anyone else!

The ability to be creative is thought to be largely dependent on one's capacity to generate original ideas, although it is also necessary to have the skill to translate those ideas into a format that can be shared with others.

What is brainstroming and why is it effective?
Brainstroming is a cognitive stimulation technique that has been used for centuries to improve focus, memory, and thought processes. While there are many different ways to use brainstroming, the most common application is called the “six windows of awareness” Technique. This approach provides individuals with six specific windows of focus in which they can engage in focused thought. The windows of awareness can be found at different points in your mind, depending on what you are thinking or studying.
