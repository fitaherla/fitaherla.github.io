Defining big ideas
There are a lot of big ideas out there. But what exactly are they? And how can we define them?
A big idea is an overarching concept or theme that is central to a work of art, literature, or philosophy. It is usually something that the author wants to communicate to the audience, and it can be interpreted in many ways.

One way to think of a big idea is as a symbol or motif that represents something larger than itself. For example, in the novel The Great Gatsby, the green light on Daisy Buchanan’s dock represents hope and possibility. In Shakespeare’s play Romeo and Juliet, the balcony scene is a symbol of young love and its potential for tragedy.

Another way to define a big idea is as an abstract concept that can be explored in different ways.

What are the latest invention ideas?
The latest invention ideas include artificial intelligence, 3D printing, and self-healing materials. Artificial intelligence is a field of study that focuses on creating machines that can think for themselves. The development of this technology has led to the development of new ways to interact with machines and create complex algorithms. 3D printing is a process where printers print items using two dimensional images instead of traditional three dimensional objects. This technology has allowed for the creation of large numbers of products without having to rely on traditional manufacturing methods. Self-healing materials are materials that can heal themselves on contact or after being exposed to an environment that contains chemicals or other toxins.
