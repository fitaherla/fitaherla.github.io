When it comes to innovation, there are a few things that always seem to set a company apart from the rest. Perhaps the most well-known example is Silicon Valley’s “technology shock,” where innovative new technologies emerged suddenly and explosively in the early 1960s. At other times, companies can be credited for developing innovative products or services over time, such as Levi Strauss and Co.'s jeans becoming popular after they were first developed in the 1800s.

Home decorating ideas: From simple to intricate
Start with the basics: A home is a place of refuge, and comfort. You should make it your own by filling it with comfortable and stylish pieces that will help you relax and feel at home. Here are some simple but effective home decorating ideas to get you started:
1. Add a design element with an old piece of furniture. Search online or in stores for pieces that are already in good condition and were once used as part of a décor scheme. This can be either a chair or a dresser, as long as it is still in good condition and has not been updated in years. Place the piece near the entrance of your home so that people coming home see it first before getting too lost in all the other pieces on your walls.

2. Keep things fresh by using new products and trends from time to time.
