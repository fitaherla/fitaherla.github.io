How to write good content
Contentwriting isn't a one-time event. It's an ongoing, ongoing process that you can use to improve the quality of your website and increase viewership for your content. Below are some tips on how to write good content and increase viewership for your website or blog: 
1) Start with a strong opener. Your opening sentence should introduce the reader to your topic and help them understand what you're about. 

2) Use verbs correctly. Each verb needs a specific action to complete the sentence, so make sure all verbs are used correctly in your opening paragraph. For example, "I eat," "I play," "I watch." 

3) Use clear language. Your language should be easy to understand and use on a daily basis. Avoid overusing words or adjectives in your writing; they'll sound automated instead of interesting or engaging.

End result of creativity: What happens to creativity when it's used?
Creativity flourishes when it's used for good, but often its fruits are sour. In the worst case, creativity can lead to disaster, as in the case of some artists who misuse their creativity. Creative art can be beautiful and inspiring, but also can lead to catastrophe if not used for its intended purpose - creating something new and valuable.
