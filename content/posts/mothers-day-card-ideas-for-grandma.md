Customer Loyalty: What is customer loyalty and how can it be increased in your business?
Customer loyalty is one of the most important aspects of a business. It is the basis for why people are customers and how they can be continued to be customers. Loyalty is increased when businesses provide value, implement change, and are responsive to customer needs. Here are three new ideas for increasing customer loyalty in your business:
1. Offer more value to customers: When you offer more value to customers, they will become more loyal. This can be done by adding features or services that are not currently available or by reducing prices. By doing this, you will create an emotional connection with your customers and increase their loyalty.

2. Change with the times: When you keep up with the latest trends in your industry, you will increase your chances of being a successful business.

The 4 types of ideas: creative, critical, problem-solving, and emotional
Creative ideas are always intoxicating, and can be a great way to get your creative juices flowing. However, it's important to be careful with what you create â€“ too much creativity can lead to problems. Here are four types of ideas that can help you get your creative juices flowing: problem-solving ideas, emotional ideas, and critical ideas.
Problem-solving Ideas: 
1) Come up with ways to make the existing structure of your business more efficient or effective. This could mean finding ways to cut costs or improve efficiency, or coming up with new ways to appeal to customers. 
2) Use your creativity in order to come up with solutions to problems that have been bothering your customers for years. For example, if you're a restaurant, come up with new menu items that appeal specifically to people who are struggling financially.
