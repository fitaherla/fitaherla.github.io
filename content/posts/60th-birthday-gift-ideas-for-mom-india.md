Invention process: How do inventors create new ideas?
Invention processes vary depending on the type of invention, and how new ideas are created. Some common methods include brainstorming, R&D, and ideation. Inventors often use different methods to create new ideas.
 brainstorming is a process where inventors come up with new ideas by thinking about what they don't know. The inventors can use any tool to help them come up with new ideas- such as paper, pencils, or a computer.

R&D is another name for brainstorming. It involves researching what other people have done and finding potential problems that could be solved by using a certain idea. This can take place in the form of studies or prototypes.

Ideation is another way to create new ideas. It's when inventors think about things that have never been thought of before and come up with possible solutions to problems.

The rules of brainstorming.
1. Brainstorming is a process that can be used to generate ideas and solve problems.
2. There are some rules that should be followed when brainstorming, in order to make it more effective.

3. The first rule is to suspend judgment while ideas are being generated. This means that no idea should be immediately rejected, no matter how crazy it may seem at first.

4. The second rule is to allow for freewheeling association. This means that ideas should be generated without any restrictions, and any connections between ideas should be explored.

5. The third rule is to build on the ideas of others. This means that once an idea has been suggested, others should try to build on it and expand upon it.

6. The fourth rule is to record all of the ideas that are generated during the brainstorming session.

How to come up with big ideas
When it comes to coming up with big ideas, the first step is to have a clear idea of what you want your business to achieve. Once you know what you want, it's time to start thinking about how you can achieve it. Here are four tips for coming up with big ideas: 
1. Look at your industry and think about how you could improve it. Why isn't there enough innovation in this industry? Why are some products more popular than others? What could be done to make sure that your product or service is better?
2. Come up with a goal that you can focus on and work towards. This will help give you the motivation to keep going when the going gets tough. Without a goal, it's hard to stay motivated and keep exploring new ideas. 
3. Make a list of possible ways that your business could improve.
