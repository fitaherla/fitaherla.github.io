Defining creativity
In order to come up with creative ideas, one must first understand what creativity is. Creativity is the ability to come up with new and innovative ideas. It is often associated with art and music, but it can also be found in other areas of life such as problem-solving, business, and even personal relationships.
There are many different ways to define creativity. Some people believe that it is simply the ability to come up with new ideas, while others believe that it is the ability to execute those ideas in a way that is both unique and effective. Still others believe that creativity is a combination of both of these things.

Regardless of how you define it, there are certain things that are necessary for creativity to occur. These include a willingness to take risks, an open mind, and the ability to think outside the box.

What is invention?
Invention, sometimes called the discovery of a valuable new technology or process, is a moment when an idea or design comes to someone and they decide to put it into use. Invention can be something as simple as a new way of making a product, or something more complex like creating a new method for extracting oil from coal. It can come from anyone – even people who have nothing to lose. Inventors are often able to see their ideas through to the end, and often find new ways to make their products or processes even more effective. For example, inventors who create air-conditioning technology may not have thought about how it would be used in hot climates, but they came up with a better way to cool buildings and this has led to new applications for the technology all over the world.
