Conclusion
Innovation is not a new concept. It has been around since the beginning of time. However, it has only recently become a buzzword in the business world.
Innovation is the process of taking an idea and turning it into a reality. It is about creating something new or improving upon something that already exists. Innovation can be big or small. It can be something as simple as a new way to make a cup of coffee or as complex as developing a new form of renewable energy.

There are four main types of innovation: product, process, business model, and social. Product innovation is about creating new products or improving upon existing ones. Process innovation is about improving the way things are done. Business model innovation is about changing the way businesses operate. Social innovation is about solving social problems in new and innovative ways.

What is brainstroming and how does it work?
Brainstroming is a form of meditation that involves focusing on one’s thoughts and sensations within the present moment. The goal of brainstroming is to help improve concentration, focus, and productivity. Brainstroming can be done during any time of day or night, and can be done in any environment. It is important to note that brainstroming is not a new technique; it has been used by Nobel Prize-winning scientists and businessmen for centuries. However, the popularity of brainstroming has increased in recent years due to its potential benefits.
