The Process of Invention: How ideas are born and developed
Invention is the process by which new ideas are born and developed. It starts with a brainstorming session, where people come up with ideas for products or services. Next, the team that will be working on developing these ideas must come up with a plan for how to make this idea a reality. This includes coming up with a concept, creating drawings, and finally making prototypes. Once these prototypes have been created, it is then important to test them to see if they are effective. If not, then the team must go back and revise their plan until they are successful.

Types of ideas: What should be in a good idea?
Ideas are a vital ingredient in any business or product. They can be used to originate new concepts, improve on an existing product, or create a new market. However, how well ideas are executed can greatly affect their success. Here are a few tips on how to make your ideas executable:
1. Be specific: The first step in Executing an Idea is to be specific about what you want your idea to achieve. This will help you to focus and ensure that your idea is communicated effectively.

2. Be Efficient: Once you have identified what you want your idea to achieve, it is important to focus on how best to achieve it within the confines of your time and resources. This means being efficient in both the development of your idea and the execution of it.
