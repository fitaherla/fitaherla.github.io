The power of big ideas
There are certain ideas that have the power to change the world. These are the big ideas. And while some people may think that only governments and large organizations have the ability to enact change on a global scale, history has shown us time and again that it is often the power of an individual with a big idea that can make the biggest difference.
One person with a big idea can start a movement that changes the way we think about an issue or problem. We’ve seen it happen with civil rights, women’s rights, and environmental issues. It is one person who has the courage to stand up and say “this is wrong” or “this needs to change” who can start a chain reaction that leads to real and lasting change.

What is big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that always come to mind. From economic reforms to social programs, big ideas are always on the radar of policy-makers. However, what exactly makes a good big idea?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to big ideas, but some key elements include: having a clear vision and goals, being able to develop and test the idea in a meaningful way, and being able to build on existing policies or programs.

This year's Winter Olympics in Sochi may be seen as an opportunity for fresh thinking about big ideas. While many experts predict that the Games will not produce any significant newbig ideas, that does not mean that there is not potential for innovation.

Brainstorming: What is brainstorming?
The purpose of brainstorming is to come up with new and innovative ideas. However, many people confuse brainstorming with brainstorming exercises. The two are completely different activities.
In a brainstorm, you don’t actually come up with new ideas; you just share your thoughts and ideas with others. It can be a great way to get feedback on what you’re working on and to get feedback on how others might view your idea.

When using brainstorming exercises, however, it’s important to keep the focus on coming up with new and innovative ideas. These exercises help you develop your thinking skills, but they aren’t substitutes for actual creative problem-solving.

Research/Inspiration: What have other bloggers or businesses done that you’re inspired by?
Creative ideas come from all around us, and some are more obvious than others. Sometimes all you need is inspiration, and other times it can take a little more effort to find it. Here are a few examples of creative ideas that have inspired me in the past: 
1. Creating a blog – This one’s easy enough, right? Just start writing and share your thoughts with the world. What do other bloggers or businesses do that you’re inspired by? You might be surprised at how much they have in common! 

2. starting a business – This is another easy one! If you have the passion and the drive, there’s no reason not to start your own business. It can be a lot of hard work, but it can also be really rewarding if you hit your goals.
