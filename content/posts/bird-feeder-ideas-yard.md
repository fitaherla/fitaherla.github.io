The process of invention:
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that can be used in a business or other activity. It can take many different forms, but the basic process is the same: you come up with a solution to a problem and then create a prototype to see if it works.
Invention is an important part of any business, and it can help make things easier for people who are working hard to get things done. It also allows companies to keep their products and services fresh, and it makes it easier for people to find what they need when they need it.

Business: How do you make money from invention ideas?
If you're an inventor, there are a few things you need to keep in mind if you want to make some money from your invention ideas. 
First, it's important to come up with interesting and novel ideas that have potential market value. In order to get your idea accepted by the public, you'll need to supply clear evidence that your product or service is better than the competition.

Second, do your research before starting a business. Make sure you understand what kind of expenses associated with developing and selling your product or service and how much money you'll actually be making from each sale.

Finally, be prepared for long hours and plenty of travel (especially if your idea involves selling products or services online). This isn't easy work - but it's definitely worth it when it comes to making money from your invention ideas!
