Invention ideas are something that can be created easily and with little effort. To come up with them, you need to have a creative process in mind. This will help you come up with new ideas that could change the way the world does business or how we live our lives. Without a creative process, it can be hard to come up with unique and interesting inventions. The following tips can help you get started:
1. brainstorming is an essential part of creative process. When you have no idea what you want to create, brainstorming will help you gather information and develop ideas.

2. take your time when brainstorming. Don’t force yourself to think of ideas right away – allow yourself some time to calm down and relax before coming up with new ones.
