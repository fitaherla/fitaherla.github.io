Taking Action: How do you take action when you have creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new products to a better way to do things. When you have creative ideas, it can be hard to know what to do with them. Here are three tips for taking action on your ideas:
1. Research your idea thoroughly before starting anything. This will help you understand the feasibility of the idea and whether or not it is something that is possible or even desirable.

2. Make a prototype of your idea. This will give you a rough idea of how your product or service will look and feel. You can then test this out on customers or see if there is enough demand for the idea to actually start manufacturing it.

3. Take action! Once you have some prototypes and data, it’s time to take action!

The word "innovation" is often used to describe how different new products or services are brought to market, but it has also been defined as the process of making something new from scratch. In business, innovation can mean different things to different people, and it can often be tougher than simply coming up with a new idea. Sometimes, companies have to go beyond the basics of product design and development in order to come up with innovative solutions.
