Definition of art: What is the difference between art and creativity?
Creativity is the ability to come up with ideas and concepts that are new or different from what has been done before. Art, on the other hand, is the creation of art. There are many different definitions of art, but one definition that is often used is "the activity of making something that appeals to the senses." So, while creativity and art can have different meanings, they both involve coming up with new ideas and concepts.
