Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of creating new products, services or businesses. It can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is when a new idea or product is different from what has been done before and is potential savior for a company or industry. Innovation can also refer to ideas for change in how things are done or something that makes a business more efficient or profitable. The definition of innovation may vary from company to company, but it is important to have an understanding of what it means when a business refers to itself as being “invention-driven.

2. It can be therapeutic. Doing something with your hands can be very calming and satisfying. It can help take your mind off of your stressful day-to-day life and give you a sense of accomplishment when you finish a project.

3. It can be a bonding experience.
