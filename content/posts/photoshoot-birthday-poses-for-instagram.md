The Problem/Solution: How do you come up with an idea?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how to come up with an idea, but following a few simple steps can help. First, identify what you want to create. This can be anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. Next, think about what others may have done or seen that would inspire you. If you have this kind of inspiration, you can begin working on your idea by imagining what people might be able to do with your product or service. Finally, come up with ways to make your idea even better. By doing this, you will not only increase the chances that your product or service will be successful, but also give yourself the opportunity to improve on any mistakes that may have been made in the early stages of development.

How to invent something: Share tips on how to come up with new ideas.
Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it’s a product, process or service. It’s a key part of innovation and economic growth. To be successful, you need to have a good idea and the drive to see it through.
So how do you come up with new ideas? There are a few methods you can try:

1. Brainstorming: This is a great way to generate ideas with a group. Get together with some friends or colleagues and just start throwing out ideas. The more outrageous the better – you can always tone it down later. The point is to get the creative juices flowing and come up with as many ideas as possible.

2. Research: Sometimes the best ideas come from understanding what already exists and finding ways to improve upon it.
