Conclusion: What are some potential applications of brainstroming?
Brainstroming is a type of meditation that has been found to have many potential applications. In one study, participants were asked to focus on a specific object for 3 minutes. After the 3 minutes had passed, they were given a letter grade based on how much attention they had paid to the object throughout the session. The study found that those who had practiced brainstroming were more likely to receive an A than those who did not. Another study found that brainstroming was able to improve working memory in younger adults. It was also shown that practicing brainstroming improved mood and cognitive performance.
