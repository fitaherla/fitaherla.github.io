The process: How to go from idea to finished product
Creative ideas are something that can be created from any source. There are a few different ways to go from idea to finished product, but the most common way is through brainstorming. By brainstorming, you can come up with as many different ideas as possible and see which ones seem to be the best. Once you have a few good ideas, it's time to start developing them into a plan. This process is called design thinking, and it's important to remember that the final product should be unique to you.

What is innovation and why do we need it?
Innovation is the ability to come up with new ways of doing things. It can be in the form of a new product, service, or idea. Innovation is important because it gives businesses and individuals the chance to try something and see if it works or not.
There are a few different types of innovation: scientific, technological, economic, social and cultural. Scientific innovation occurs when scientists come up with new ways to study the world around them and improve our understanding of it. Technical innovation happens when companies or governments find new ways to make products or services more efficient or effective. Economic innovation happens when companies or governments find new ways to make money by selling their products or services. Social innovation happens when people come up with ideas for different organizations or societies that could benefit from them.
