The rules of brainstorming.
1. Brainstorming is a process that can be used to generate ideas and solve problems.
2. There are some rules that should be followed when brainstorming, in order to make it more effective.

3. The first rule is to suspend judgment while ideas are being generated. This means that no idea should be immediately rejected, no matter how crazy it may seem at first.

4. The second rule is to allow for freewheeling association. This means that ideas should be generated without any restrictions, and any connections between ideas should be explored.

5. The third rule is to build on the ideas of others. This means that once an idea has been suggested, others should try to build on it and expand upon it.

6. The fourth rule is to record all of the ideas that are generated during the brainstorming session.

The process of inventing: Describe the process of inventing, from idea to execution.
Invention is the process of bringing an idea or concept into reality. Inventors typically start with an idea, which they then refine and develop through research and experimentation. Once they have a prototype or working model of their invention, they may test it to see how well it works. If it is successful, they may then apply for a patent to protect their invention from being copied or used without permission. Invention is a creative process, and like any creative endeavor, it requires passion, dedication, and hard work.
