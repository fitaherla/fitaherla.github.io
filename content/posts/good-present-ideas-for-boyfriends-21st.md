The five types of brainstorming: open, collaborative, focused, problem-solving, and creative.
Brainstorming is one of the most essential skills for any business or professional. It can be used for creative problem solving, brainstorming for ideas for products and services, and more. However, not all brainstorming sessions are created equal. Here are five different types of brainstorming that can help improve your session productivity: 
1. Open brainstorming: This type of brainstorming is usually used when there is no specific goal to achieve or when everyone is free to come and go as they please. In this type of session, everyone is given a set amount of time to come up with ideas and then those ideas are prioritized based on how important they think they are.

2. Collaborative brainstorming: This type of brainstorming helps teams work together towards a common goal.

How to Use Innovation to Drive Results
Innovations can help businesses achieve success. Here are four ways to leverage innovation to drive results:
1. Use innovation to improve productivity and efficiency. When products are redesigned or new processes are created, employees can be more efficient in their work. This can lead to reduced costs and increased profits.
