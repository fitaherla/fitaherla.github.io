From the early days of mankind, when people were just starting to learn how to make things, Invention has always been an important part of human life.

Here are some examples of inventions that have made a big difference in the world:

Both men were working on different projects at the time, but they came up with a working prototype together. In 1876, they announced their findings to the public and quickly became famous for their work.
