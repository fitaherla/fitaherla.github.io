What is an invention?
An invention is a new product, process or service that is novel and different from those already in use. Inventions can come from anyone - a small business owner, inventor, scientist or just someone who has an idea for a better way to do something. Some of the most famous inventions include the computer, the telephone and theimplication machine. 
Invention can have many benefits for both the inventor and their customers - often they are the first to bring a product to market that offers a new and exciting solution. The key is to ensure that ideas are properly considered before they are turned into an invention - anything can happen in this process!

Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
Invention is the process of creating something new. It can be an idea, a product, a service, or a process. Inventors are people who create new things. They have inventive minds and are always looking for ways to improve upon what already exists.
The invention process involves four main steps: ideation, development, prototype testing, and commercialization. Ideation is the stage in which an inventor comes up with an idea for a new product or service. Development is the stage in which the inventor turns the idea into a plan and begins to create a prototype. Prototype testing is the stage in which the prototype is put to the test to see if it works as intended. Commercialization is the stage in which the invention is made available to consumers.

Inventions can be either big or small.
