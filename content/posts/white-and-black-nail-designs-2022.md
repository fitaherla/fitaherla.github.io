What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of creating new products, services, or ideas that are different from the ones that have been before. It can be called creative change, and it can happen in a number of ways: through product development (racting evidence to create a new product), market research (finding out what people want and need), or process improvement (making things easier or faster). Innovation is often about finding solutions to problems that people have never considered before.
