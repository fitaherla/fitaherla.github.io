Business Strategies for INVENTIONS: What should I do when my invention is accepted?
When your invention is accepted, it can be a huge feeling. It's a sign that you've made something that people will want and use. But there are a few things to keep in mind if your invention is accepted. 
First, make sure you're prepared for the reaction. This could be anything from excitement to skepticism. You'll need to be sure that your idea is unique and worth considering. 
Second, make sure you're doing everything you can to promote your invention. This might include creating buzz around it, making yourself available to answer any questions people have, or writing articles about your invention to help spread the word. 
Finally, be prepared for the financial challenges that come with being an inventor. This might mean having to find investors or selling your idea rights in order to get started on developing it commercially.
