How To Come Up With Ideas: What are some creative ways to come up with ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to help something else become a reality. Whether it’s coming up with a new product idea or coming up with a plan to improve something you’re working on, creativity is essential to any successful project. Here are four tips for coming up with creative ideas: 1. Take your time – Don’t try to come up with an idea right away. In most cases, it won’t be the best option, and you may not get very far without some effort. 2. Be open to new ideas – There are always going to be new ways of thinking when it comes to ideas, so don’t be afraid to experiment.

The different types of Invention: What are the different types of inventions?
Invention is a process of creating a new product or service from scratch. There are many different types of inventions, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Below are three examples of invention:
1) A new type of transportation: A car is an invention, because it has been around for centuries. 
2) A new type of food: We have invented grains and potatoes, so there is no one food that can be called "rice" or "potatoes." 
3) A new way to grow plants: We've invented peas and carrots, so there's no need for planting seeds in the ground all year round.
