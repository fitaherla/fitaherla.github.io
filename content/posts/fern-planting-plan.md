Definition of innovation: What is it, and how does it differ from other types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new and unique products or services that solve a problem. It can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that innovation is the creation of a new way of doing something. Innovation can come from anywhere in the company, including the idea behind the product or service, as well as from within team members themselves. In order to be effective, innovation must be mutual and collaborative; it should not just rely on one person’s ideas or insights. 
One key difference between innovation and other forms of innovation is its focus on solving problems. Other types of innovation often seek to create new products or services that appeal to consumers (instead of solving problems), which can lead to less innovation overall. Innovation is instead focused on helping companies achieve their goals by improving their products or services.

Layout: How can you make your living space more organized and comfortable?
Organizing your home can help you feel more comfortable and organized. There are many ways to do this, so find one that works best for you. Here are some ideas:
-Start by taking a look at what is already in your home and take down anything that isn't necessary. This will make room for new things and make your living space more organized.

-Create a basic organizational system for your home with drawers, shelves, boxes, and folders. You can use these to store clothes, tools, or other belongings.

-Expand the idea of organization by adding another level of complexity. For example, you could add removable dividers between rooms or add built-in shelving to main walls. This will give your living space more depth and organization without costing a lot of money.
