Types of creativity: How different forms of creativity can be used to create things
Creativity is a wide term, and there are many different ways to define it. Some people might say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. Others might say that creativity is the ability to perceive and express what you see in your world. Still others might say that creativity is simply doing something new and exciting. Here are three types of creativity: creative art, creative writing, and creative music.
Creative art can be used for a variety of purposes, from producing works of art to creating stories and songs. Creative writing can be used for personal journals or novels, while creative music can be used to produce soundtracks or sound poems. All three forms of creativity can be used in different ways to create things unique and memorable.
