What are some new ideas?
There are a lot of new ideas out there these days. Here are some of the most popular: 
1) Introduction to computer programming – This is a new course that has been moderately successful in increasing interest in computer science. It covers everything from basic coding to more complex topics, making it an excellent introduction to the field for those who want to start homebrewing or develop their own software projects. 
2) A way for people with mental health conditions to interact with the world – This is a trend that is growing slowly but surely, as more and more people realize just how important it is for people with mental health conditions to have access to support and information (and not just be left on their own). Some companies are starting to create websites and apps specifically for people with mental health conditions, so this trend is only going to continue growing.

The Process of Being Creative
When it comes to creative ideas, the process can be a bit mysterious. Where do they come from? How can you get more of them? While there's no one answer to these questions, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of having a great idea.
First, make sure you're exposing yourself to new things. Ideas often come from seeing something in a new way or combining two disparate things. If you're stuck in the same old routine, it'll be harder to have those "a-ha!" moments.

 Second, give yourself time and space to daydream. Once you have an idea, it's important to let it percolate for a while before taking action on it. Often, the best ideas come when you're not actively trying to think of one.

Finally, don't be afraid to experiment and take risks.
