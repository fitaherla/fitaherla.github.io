What are your goals?
When it comes to goal setting, there are a few different things to consider. Whether you haveSpecific goals or general ones, the following are helpful tips:
1. Set specific deadlines: This is one of the most important things to remember when goal setting. If you don’t have a deadline, it will be much harder to get started on your goal. A good way to set a deadline is by saying that you want a certain outcome by a certain date (e.g., “I want my raise in two months”).

2. Create measurable goals: By using measurable goals, you can track and measure how well your goal is coming along. This helps you identify areas that need improvement and makes setting larger goals more manageable.

The importance of ideas
Ideas are the lifeblood of any organization. Without them, a company would be in trouble. They can be used to improve products or to create new ideas for businesses. But even more important, ideas are the engine that drives innovation and growth.
But what are they? How do they come about? And how do they affect our business?

Ideas come from all over the place. Sometimes they come from people who have had some great ideas, and other times they come from others who have had some great ideas but don't know how to put them into a product or service that can make money for the company.

Ideas also come from customers. Sometimes we get an idea from someone who is using our product or service, and sometimes we get an idea from somebody who is not using our product or service but thinks it would be a good idea.

What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but they also come with risk. If your idea is too risky, it won’t get traction and may never see the light of day. That’s why it’s essential to be sure your idea is worth taking on. There are a few key principles that help make an idea a good one: It should be something people want or need; it should be novel and have potential to change the world; it should have a commercial Potential; and it should be feasible to execute. Here are three examples of ideas that researchers at Imperial College London say might just be worth pursuing: 
1. A contact lens that records what you see When contact lenses become more prevalent, many people will likely want to know what they’re looking at. This could lead to new ways for seeing the world and improving safety for everyone involved.
