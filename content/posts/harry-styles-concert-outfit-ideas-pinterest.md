When it comes to creating effective art, there are a few things you can do to help. Here are some tips that may help improve your work: 
1. Start with a good idea. When you have an idea for an artwork, the next step is to develop it into a complete work. This means working on the ideas and concepts behind your piece before starting on the actual painting or sculpture. 

2. Take advantage of constructive criticism. A lot of times it’s helpful to get feedback from other people in order to improve your pieces. It will also give you a better understanding of what worked and what didn’t work in your work overall. 

3. Be persistent. The best way to stay motivated when painting or sculpture is to keep pushing yourself.

What are the future ideas for our country?
In 2022, many believe that the United States should consider a new immigration policy that prioritized people who can contribute to society. Ideas for this policy could include increasing the number of refugees who are allowed into the country, increasing the number of visas available for skilled immigrants, and lowering the waiting times for citizenship. Another idea is to have a more open exchange market between the US and other countries, which would create jobs and increase wages.
