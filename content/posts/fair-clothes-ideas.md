For example, if your project involves a DIY floor lamp, make sure the wiring is correct before trying to install the lamp. If you've never built any kind of project before, it's important to get help from a family member or friend who can provide tips on how to fix a problem.

Innovation can also be seen as an indicator of success in a business. For example, Google was first to bring the internet to the masses in 1996 and Amazon has been selling books online for centuries. Despite these long histories, both entities have faced many challenges and have eventually become world-renowned companies.
