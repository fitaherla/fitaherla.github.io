Creativity is often misunderstood and its definition can be difficult to determine. Some say creativity refers to the ability to come up with new ideas, while others define creativity as the ability to see things in a different way or express oneself through art. There are many definitions for creativity, but one that stands out is the idea that creativity is important for artists because it allows them to express themselves in a unique way. This is why creativity has been seen as such an important asset for many individuals, businesses, and countries over the years.

What are big ideas?
Ideas are what change the world. They are what can make a difference in your life. Whether you're looking to start something new orto keep an old idea alive, big ideas are essential to any successful project. Here's how to come up with some of your own: 
-Think outside the box: There's no one right way to approach big ideas, but taking a different approach can often lead to more creative and successful outcomes. By thinking outside the box, you can come up with concepts that may not have been considered before. 

-Be persistent: Big ideas take time and effort to develop into something viable and successful. Don't be afraid to put in the hard work â€“ it'll pay off in the end.
