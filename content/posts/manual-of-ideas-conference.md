Definition of invention: What is it and what does it mean for society?
Invention is the process of creating something new from something existing. It can be anything from a new product to a new idea for a business. Inventions have a big impact on society because they can change the way we live and work. They can also create new opportunities for businesses and people.
One of the key definitions for invention is "a means of producing something which had not been produced before, or that is different from what has been produced previously." This definition encompasses everything from products to ideas to methods of transportation. Inventors are often incredibly creative and come up with amazing ideas that could change the world. Without invention, there would likely be very few innovations in our lives.

Invention has played an important role in human history since prehistoric times. For example, early humans used tools to make their way through life and get food and shelter.

What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a great way to get your creative juices flowing and come up with new solutions to problems. There are many different creative ideas out there, so you need to find the ones that fit your needs and interests. Here are some ideas to get started: 
-Create a petition: This is a great way to get people’s attention and show them how you feel about something. You can start by creating a simple Petition on change.org or any other website. Once you have made your case, offer anyone who will listen an argument for why they should change the policy. 

-Dare yourself: If you don’t know what you want or aren’t sure how to get started, take some risks and try something new. Take on an assignment or complete a project that isn’t immediately related to your current lifestyle.
