Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other types of change?
Innovation is the process of change that is driven by a new idea, hypothesis or perspective. It can be defined in many ways, but one way to think of it is as a shift in perspective or approach to problem solving. Innovation often requires risk and creativity, and it can be difficult to predict which trends will lead to innovation and which won't.

Conclusion: What are the implications of innovation for business?
Invention has been the backbone of business for centuries. When something is new, businesses can capitalize on it to increase sales and create new products or services. However, recent innovations have created new challenges for businesses as they try to keep up with the technology. For example, Apple's iPhone has made phone texting and talking on the go a must-have feature for many people. However, this has also led to increased competition in the market as text messaging companies such as WhatsApp and Viber offer better rates and features for their users. Additionally, Google's Chromebook computer is revolutionizing educational resources by making them more accessible online. These are just a few examples of how innovation can impact businesses in different ways.

In the world of technology, there are a number of new ideas that come up constantly. Some of these ideas may be more innovative than others, but all of them have the potential to make a big impact on the way we live our lives. Here are a few examples:

The use of Blockchain technology: This technology is very similar to Bitcoin, but instead of using cryptography to secure transactions, Blockchain uses code that is kept track of and can be verified by other computers. This allows for secure and transparent transactions, which is why it has become so popular in recent years.

2. The use of AI*: This technology is quickly becoming one of the most important aspects of modern life. AI has been used in a variety of ways over the years, but its potential as an employer or strategist has yet to be fully realized.
