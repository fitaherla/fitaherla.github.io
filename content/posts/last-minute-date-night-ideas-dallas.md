Types of creativity: How different forms of creativity can be used to create things
Creativity is a wide term, and there are many different ways to define it. Some people might say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. Others might say that creativity is the ability to perceive and express what you see in your world. Still others might say that creativity is simply doing something new and exciting. Here are three types of creativity: creative art, creative writing, and creative music.
Creative art can be used for a variety of purposes, from producing works of art to creating stories and songs. Creative writing can be used for personal journals or novels, while creative music can be used to produce soundtracks or sound poems.

what are creative ideas?
A creative idea is an original thought or concept that has the potential to be developed into something tangible. It is often associated with innovation and creativity, and is often driven by a need or desire to solve a problem.
There are many ways to generate creative ideas, but some common methods include brainstorming, mind mapping, and using lateral thinking techniques. Once an idea has been generated, it is often important to incubate it, or let it percolate for a while before taking action on it. This can help to ensure that the idea is fully formed and that all potential avenues have been explored.

While there is no one guaranteed formula for generating creative ideas, there are certain things that can help to foster an environment where they are more likely to occur.
