brainstorming: What is it?
brainstorming is a process of coming up with new ideas. It can be used for both personal and professional purposes. There are a variety of ways to brainstorm, but the most common one is using a list or Grid Method.
One way to brainstorm ideas is by using a list or Grid Method. This method consists of creating a list of 10-15 items and then listing them in order from most to least important. After doing this, you should be able to come up with at least 2-3 ideas per item on the list.

Another way to brainstorm ideas is by using an online tool such as Google Sheets or Excel. These tools allow you to create grids that can be filled with any type of data (pictures, numbers, tables, etc).
