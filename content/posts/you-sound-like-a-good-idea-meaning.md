Patents: What are the benefits and challenges of patents?
Patents are a form of intellectual property that allows an inventor to protect their ideas for products or services with a certain number of years after they come up with them. There are many benefits to patents, including helping to protect the inventor's intellectual property, increasing the chance that their idea will be developed into a successful product or service, and increasing the potential for royalties and other financial compensation that may be available to the inventor. There are also some challenges to patents, including ensuring that the invention is actually protected by a patent and that it is not copied or used without consent from the inventor.

Introduce the topic of invention.
Inventors are constantly looking for ways to make our lives easier. They create new products or services that help us save time and money. But what motivates these inventors? What drives them to continue coming up with new ideas?
For many inventors, it’s the challenge of solving a problem. They see something that doesn’t work well or could be improved, and they set out to find a solution. In some cases, the inventor is motivated by the potential to make money from their invention. But for many, it’s simply the satisfaction of knowing they’ve created something that will make people’s lives better.
