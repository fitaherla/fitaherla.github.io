Invention history: How did some of the earliest inventions get started?
Inventions have a long and complicated history, with some getting started much earlier than others. Here are some of the most notable inventions, starting with the oldest:
The first true computer was built in the late 17th century by Johannes Gutenberg, who used a printing press to create movable type. The printing press had potential to spread literacy and knowledge far beyond the small town where Gutenberg resided.

Invention ideas are often hatched out of boredom or frustration. In 1823, Charles Babbage designed a machine that could solve problems in mathematics that had never been solved before. The machine was code-named Analytical Engine and it was not completed until 1831.

But even the earliest machines didn’t always get results they were hoping for.

Types of creativity: How do different types of creativity differ?
Creativity is a relative term. Some people may say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, while others might say that creativity is the process of coming up with new ways to do something. There are many different types of creativity, and it all comes down to what you are looking for in a creative project. Here are three examples: art, design, and technology.
Art: Art is the creation of objects or pictures that are not related to anything else in the world. It can be done in any form, whether it’s making art out of everyday things like paperclips or painting an entire room with just some colors and shapes.

Design: Design is the process of creating designs that are unique and effective. It can be done through drawings, paintings, or even software programs.
