Innovative thinking: How do we think differently to change things?
We all know that innovation is key to success in any business. But what does it mean when we talk about innovation?
Innovation can be defined as the process of designing, producing, and using a new product or service in order to improve the quality or usability of an existing product. There are many different ways to think about innovation, but four main themes will be used throughout this article:1) new ways of looking at old problems; 2) using technology to help solve problems; 3) breaking down barriers between ideas and reality; and 4) creating value for others. 

When you think about innovative thinking, you first need to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Instead, it’s important to explore different methods and concepts in order to find the most effective way to achieve your goals.

What are some bad ideas?
New ideas can be a good thing, or a bad thing depending on how they're executed. Here are some bad ideas that could lead to negative outcomes: 
1. A new law that restricts freedom of speech. This law could lead to people being arrested and/or fined for expressing their opinions out of fear of retribution from the government. 
2. A plan to close all schools in the city in order to provide more public education. This plan would deprive children of instruction and would lead to an increase in crime rates in the city. 
3. Requiring businesses owners to install security cameras inside their businesses in order to catch thieves and criminals. This would require owners to spend money on something that isn't necessary and would also create an inconvenience for customers who need access to their businesses without having their business broken into.
