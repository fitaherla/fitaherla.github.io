What are some creative ideas?
Creativity is something that everyone has in them. Whether it's coming up with new ideas for a project, or just coming up with new ways to see things, creativity is always a good thing. Here are some creative ideas to get you started: 
1) Use color to bring life to your designs. Add a splash of color to any design and it will look more interesting and realistic. 
2) Think outside the box and come up with different solutions for problems. Remove the usual constraints and see how you can solve a problem in a creative way. 
3) Take risks and experiment with new technologies. When you're working on a project, it's important not to be afraid of making mistakes. risked experimenting with new technologies can lead to better results than simply following conventional wisdom. 
4) Get inspired by others' work and learn from their mistakes.

Trends in mobility: How will new transportation systems make it easier for people to connect and do their day-to-day tasks?
In the coming years, new transportation systems are going to make it easier for people to connect and do their day-to-day tasks. One of the most significant changes will be the growth of ride-sharing services. Ride-sharing platforms allow people to borrow a car from someone else, and then use it to drive around town or go to different places. This type of transportation system is becoming more popular every day, and it is just a matter of time until it becomes more widespread.
Another major change in the future will be the increasing popularity of bike lanes. Bike lanes are special pavement designs that help cyclists have more space to move around. These lanes are often built near busy intersections so that drivers can’t easily run into them.
