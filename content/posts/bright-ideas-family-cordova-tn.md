Home decorating ideas: From simple to intricate
Start with the basics: A home is a place of refuge, and comfort. You should make it your own by filling it with comfortable and stylish pieces that will help you relax and feel at home. Here are some simple but effective home decorating ideas to get you started:
1. Add a design element with an old piece of furniture. Search online or in stores for pieces that are already in good condition and were once used as part of a décor scheme. This can be either a chair or a dresser, as long as it is still in good condition and has not been updated in years. Place the piece near the entrance of your home so that people coming home see it first before getting too lost in all the other pieces on your walls.

2. Keep things fresh by using new products and trends from time to time.

The future of transportation
The future of transportation is packed with potential. Some of the ideas being floated include: driverless cars, totally autonomous transportation, and even flying cars. All of these projects have a lot of potential to improve our quality of life and save us money in the long run. But how do you go about making these ideas a reality? And what are some early steps that could help make them a reality? Here are four tips: 
1. Start with small steps 
If you want to see large-scale transportation projects take off, it’s important to start with small steps. This means taking things like creating bike lanes or getting single-occupancy vehicles registered on the road. It also means looking at ways to reduce congestion and improve safety. 
2. Get involved in community deliberations 
Community deliberations are key in helping to create successful transportation projects.
