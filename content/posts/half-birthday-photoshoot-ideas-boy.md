Creativity is a word that is often used interchangeably with art, design, science and technology. Each of these fields has its own approach to creativity, which can be seen in different ways.

1. Remove any obstacles from your way - remove any fliers, posters or other adornments that areinghamatairport-style wallpaper or carpets. You don't need them and they can add clutter and unsightliness.
