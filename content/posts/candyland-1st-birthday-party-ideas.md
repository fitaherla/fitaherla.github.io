The winner is the one that manages to get the most information into their brain before the other person does. Brainstroming can be harnessed for various purposes, such as improving performance at work or school, making better decisions, and increasing productivity.

The three types of creativity: originality, imagination, and inventions
Creativity is a difficult quality to definition, as there are many different ways to define creativity. One example is imagining something or creating something new. Another example is originality, which refers to the invention or creation of something new. 
There are three main types of creativity: imaginative, creative, and invented. Imagination is the ability to see an idea or concept in your mind and create it out of nothing. Creative creativity comes from using your imagination and coming up with ideas that you haven’t thought of before. Inventions are creations that have never been done before and usually require a lot of hard work and dedication to make them a reality.

The Process of Inventing
Invention ideas can come from many sources. Sometimes people get invention ideas from everyday life experiences, while others get their ideas from solving problems they encounter in their work. Many times, people get invention ideas from observing how other people use products or how machines operate. The key to generating invention ideas is to be observant and to look for problems that need solving.
Once you have an idea for an invention, the next step is to figure out how it will work. This involves doing some research and experimentation to develop a prototype of your invention. Once you have a working prototype, you can then test it to see if it works as intended. If it does, you can then start marketing your invention and selling it to consumers.
