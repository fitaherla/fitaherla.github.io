Introduce the topic of inventions.
Invention ideas are everywhere, and it can be hard to know where to start. Here are a few tips on how to come up with invention ideas that could make your life easier.
Start by looking at the problems you face in your everyday life. What are some things that you wish were different or that you wish you had? These problem areas could be potential starting points for your invention idea.

You can also look to other people for inspiration. Talk to friends and family members about the things they find frustrating or difficult in their daily lives. See if they have any suggestions for improvements that could make their lives easier.

Once you have a general idea of what you want to invent, it’s time to start doing some research. See if there are already products on the market that address the problem you’re trying to solve.

What is the inventor’s story?
Invention Ideas are the stuff of legends and myths. What lies beneath their surface?

However, for others, Invention Ideas may be something much more complex and amazing.

Inventors have an amazing story to tell and it often starts with one question: What if?
