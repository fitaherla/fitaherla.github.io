The benefits of creativity: What are they?
Creativity is often thought of as a noun, referring to the act or process of producing something new. However, creativity can also be seen as a verb, referring to the act or process of coming up with ideas, concepts and solutions. In order to achieve success in any field, it is important to have a good understanding of creativity and its benefits. Here are three key points that can help you achieve success: 1.
