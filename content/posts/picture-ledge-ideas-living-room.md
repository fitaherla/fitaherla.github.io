The benefits of Innovation
Innovation is the process of creating new products, services or business ideas that are conceptually different from those currently in use. In order for an innovation to be successful, it must be novel, easy to adopt, and affordable. There are a number of benefits to pursuing innovation, including increased economic growth, better customer service and reduced costs. Some of the most common benefits of innovation include:
