How to Choose the Right Painting Scheme for Your Home
There are a lot of things you can do to “paint” your home, but it’s important to choose the right scheme for your needs. A few key factors to consider include: the size of your home, budgeting restrictions, and the style of your home. If you want an artsy home with lots of details or if you want a sleek, modern look, there are many different painting schemes available. Here are some tips on how to pick the best scheme for your home:
1. Decide how much space you want to dedicate to painting. A small home may not need as much room as a larger one, so decide what scheme will work best for you and your budget.

2. Consider how much light and shadow you want in your paintings. Do you need bright colors in every room?

Patenting andprotecting inventions
Patents protect inventions from being infringing by others. Patent applications are often filled out in a variety of different ways, including but not limited to, the following: 
-Inventor biography 
-Chemical formula 
-Description of invention 
-Problem to be solved 
-Steps and method for solving the problem 
-Grant of patent 
When an inventor fills out a patent application, they are typically taking on a lot of risk. They could potentially face lawsuits if their invention is copied or used without permission. To help protect their invention, many inventors choose to patent their ideas instead of just selling them outright. By filing a patent application, an inventor is able to make sure that their invention is protected from infringement and can also get feedback from potential customers or partners about how their product might work.
