The Importance of Ideas: How important are ideas?
Ideas are important, no matter what you do. Ideas can help you solve problems and come up with new ideas. They can also help you get ahead in your career or life.

You have to be dedicate and commit to working on the idea for as long as it takes - even if it means putting in the extra hours and effort.
