CUSTOMER SERVICE: What do you think about customer service?
Most people consider customer service to be a very important aspect of their overall business. There are many different ways that customers can contact customer service and these days, there are even online tools that allow customers to do this from anywhere. In addition, many businesses now provide live support during regular business hours, so customers can get help without having to wait in line or go through a long process.
However, there are still some complaints about how well customer service is done. Some customers feel that the staff is too busy or unhelpful and they don't receive the attention they need. Others find the processes difficult or time-consuming. In any case, it's important for businesses to ensure that they provide good customer service and that their employees are aware of how to treat those who visit them.

What are big ideas?
In business, big ideas are the seeds of new business models and products. They can be anything from a novel idea to a radical change in how a product is produced. They can also be inspired by something that has worked before, or by something that someone else has tried and found to be successful. 
The key to getting your big idea off the ground is to have a clear vision for it, and then come up with specific goals and timelines for making it a reality. There are several ways to generate big ideas, including brainstorming with friends or family, talking with experts in your field, researching existing products or services, or reading articles on the subject. 

If you're not sure what kind of big idea you want to pursue, there are plenty of resources available to help you get started.
