How can we make our ideas into actual products or services?
In business, big ideas are the life blood of startups. They can turn into successful products or services with a bit of effort and creativity. But how do you make your big ideas into reality? Here are three tips:
1) Get help from a marketer: A good marketer can help you identify potential customers and convert them into paying customers.

2) Take your time: Start with small, achievable goals first and then move on to more ambitious ones as you get closer to your target market.

3) Be creative: Be open to new ideas and don't be afraid to experiment. If you can come up with an effective way to solve a problem or reach a new audience, your idea will be more likely to succeed than if you try something that's already been done before.

The main points of the article
1. Ideas can be put into many different categories, but the three most common are: problems, solutions, and potential solutions.
2. Solutions to problems are often the easiest to find, and often have obvious solutions. However, there may be multiple possible solutions that fit the problem and still meet the goals of the solution.

3. Potential solutions are more difficult to determine, but can provide a more complete or accurate solution than either a solution or a problem. They can also be less likely to cause further problems down the road.
