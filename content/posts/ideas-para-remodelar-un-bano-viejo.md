Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other types of innovation?
When it comes to innovation, there are a few key differences that can be observed. For one, innovation is not just about coming up with new ideas or products; it also includes taking risks and trying something new in order to create something better.

However, this doesn’t mean that there isn’t always a cost associated with innovative work – in fact, there often is.
