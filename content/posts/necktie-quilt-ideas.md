Creative Process: What goes into creative thinking?
Creative thinking is the process of coming up with new and innovative ideas. It can be difficult to know where to start, but here are a few tips to get started: 
1. Be open to new ideas: When you're brainstorming for new ideas, be willing to change your mind a lot. If you're not sure what something could be, give it a try. You may find that something you thought was impossible is actually possible. 

2. Be persistent: Don't give up on your ideas just because they seem hard or too risky. Keep trying until you come up with something that works and that you're satisfied with. This can take time and effort, but it's worth it in the end!

Overcoming creative blocks:
When it comes to creative blocks, the best way to overcome them is to be prepared with a toolkit of ideas. This way, when you hit a wall, you have something to fall back on. Here are four tips for ensuring that your toolkit is always full:
1. Be curious and ask questions: When you're stuck, it's often because you're not sure what you want to achieve. Asking yourself - and others - questions can help clarify your goals, and open up new possibilities for how to achieve them.

2. Take inspiration from others: A great way to jump-start your own creativity is to look at what others have done. See what inspires you, and then adapt those ideas to your own purposes.

3. Give yourself time and space: Rushing into things rarely leads to good results.
